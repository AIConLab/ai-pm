==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan – Round 1 (Structure 1)

Team roles (P1–P3) assume all spawn at structure site at T₀.  

1. Resource & Tool Staging  
  • P1 → Processing area (−69 X)  
      – Grab 1× crafting_table, 1× water_bucket, 1× scaffolding stack  
      – Run straight to build site, drop crafting_table & bucket in staging zone.  
  • P2 → Resource area (+34 X)  
      – In one sweep collect:  
        · 8 oak_logs (for 32 planks → 20 stairs)  
        · 1 stack light_gray_concrete_powder (need 25)  
        · 5 iron_bars ([all false])  
      – Return direct to build site.  
  • P3 → Resource area (same trip window as P2)  
      – Optional “runner” to back up P2 if mis-stack or snag. Otherwise proceed to site empty-handed as third builder.  

   ­— Travel times:  
     P1 Processing→Site ~45 s  
     P2/3 Resource→Site ~55 s  

2. On-Site Processing & Prep (T≈55–80 s)  
  • P1 sets up crafting_table & places water bucket on staging slab.  
  • P2 dumps all powder & iron_bars into staging chest or floor-stack.  
  • P1 crafts stairs on table:  
      – Logs→planks via 2×2 grid (8 logs→32 planks instant)  
      – 5× stair recipes (6 planks→4 stairs) = 20 stairs total (~5 s per craft ×5 =25 s)  
      – Hands stair stacks to P2 or P3 as crafted.  
  • P2 converts concrete powder → block:  
      – Lay powder in 5×5 pad, use water_bucket → concrete blocks, break into inventory (~20 s).  

3. Build Execution & Parallel Placement (T≈80 s onward)  
  • P3 (Lead Builder) reads blueprint and lays out footprint with temporary block markers or ground-level guidelines.  
  • P2 & P1 feed P3:  
      – P1 hands over stairs as needed.  
      – P2 hands over concrete blocks and iron bars.  
  • All three place blocks in lock-step:  
      – P3 focuses on orientation-critical pieces (stairs & iron_bars).  
      – P1/P2 fill light_gray_concrete.  
      – Use scaffolding for any overhead placement.  

4. Critical Path & Milestones  
  Milestone 1 (T≈55 s) – All raw materials & kit staged at site.  
  Milestone 2 (T≈80 s) – All stairs crafted & concrete blocks ready.  
  Milestone 3 (T≈85 s) – First block placed; continuous pipeline begins.  
  Milestone 4 (T≈120 s) – 50 % of blocks placed (checked against blueprint).  
  Milestone 5 (T≈150 s) – All orientation-sensitive elements (25 stairs, 5 iron_bars) placed.  
  Final check & touch-ups (T≈160 s target).  

5. Communication Checkpoints  
  • “Resources staged” @ 55 s  
  • “Processing done” @ 80 s  
  • “50 % built” @ 120 s  
  • “Stairs/Iron done” @ 150 s  

Summary of Optimizations  
  – One‐trip harvest of all raw materials (P2)  
  – One‐trip tool deployment and on-site processing (P1)  
  – Dedicated builder (P3) w/ two feeders to sustain maximum place-rate  
  – Milestone‐based pacing to avoid idle time and bottle-necks.

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr – You’re solo; you’ll execute P1 and P2 roles in sequence. Follow these two immediate task blocks with clear success checks.

1. Priority Resource & Tool Collection (T₀–T₅₀ s)
   • Step 1 (Tools & Scaffolding – “P1”):  
     – Walk to Processing Area at X –69, Y 67, Z 75 (≈45 s).  
     – Open chest at that spot and take:  
       • 1× crafting_table  
       • 1× water_bucket  
       • 1× full stack (64) scaffolding  
     – Return to Build Site at X –56.7, Y 67.1, Z 74.9 (≈45 s).  
     – At staging slab (X –56.5, Y 67, Z 75):  
       • Place crafting_table on left slab marker  
       • Place water_bucket on right slab marker  
       • Stack scaffolding beside crafting_table  
     → Success: All three items visibly staged by T≈50 s.

   • Step 2 (Raw Materials – “P2”):  
     – Immediately head from Build Site to Resource Area at X –22.7, Y 67, Z 75 (≈55 s).  
     – In one trip, break/collect into your inventory:  
       • 8 oak_logs  
       • 64 light_gray_concrete_powder (1 full stack)  
       • 5 iron_bars  
     – Return directly to Build Site staging chest at X –57, Y 67, Z 75.  
     – Deposit oak_logs, powder, iron_bars into staging chest or neat floor‐stack.  
     → Success: Logs + 64 powder + 5 bars all in staging by T≈50–55 s.

2. On‐Site Processing & Prep (T≈55–80 s)
   • At crafting_table staging spot:  
     1. Craft planks: place your 8 oak_logs → 32 oak_planks. (instant)  
     2. Craft stairs: repeat 5× stair recipe (6 planks→4 stairs) → produce 20 stairs (~5 s per craft ×5 =25 s).  
        – Keep stairs in your hotbar for immediate use.  
   • Convert concrete powder → blocks:  
     – On the ground beside staging, lay out a 5×5 pad of powder.  
     – Use water_bucket to hydrate all into light_gray_concrete.  
     – Break blocks and pick up into inventory (~20 s).  
   • Success Check @T≈80 s:  
     – 20 oak_stairs in hotbar  
     – ≥25 light_gray_concrete blocks in inventory  
     – 5 iron_bars in inventory  
     – crafting_table + water_bucket + scaffolding staged  

Next: At T≈80 s you’ll begin footprint layout and block placement. Maintain this pipeline: craft stairs → place stairs; hydrate powder → hand-feed blocks. Keep scaffolding ready for overhead.
