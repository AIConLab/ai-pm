AIPM Player Instructions - Round 7
Generated at: 20250831_001333
==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan – Round 7 (Structure 7)  
Team roles: Player A (Log-&-Plank Specialist), Player B (Fixtures & Décor Specialist), Player C (Layout & Builder Lead)

1. RESOURCE COLLECTION  
• Player A → Resource area (34.4,65.0,–83.8)  
  – Collect 80 oak_logs  
• Player B → Resource area  
  – Collect 12 chains + 12 lanterns (hanging)  
  – Collect 8 peonies  
  – Collect all 48 nether_brick_stairs (orientation-specific)  
• Player C → Immediately run to build site (–20.7,65.0,–86.1)  
  – Place scaffolding grid and outline footprint of 20 stripped_oak_wood “posts”  

2. PROCESSING WORKFLOW (Processing area: –69.4,66.0,–84.4)  
Players A & B converge on processing area as soon as they finish collecting.  
• Player A (Log→Wood pipeline)  
  1. Strip 20 oak_logs → stripped_oak_wood (netherite axe)  
  2. Craft remaining 60 logs → 240 oak_planks (×4)  
• Player B (Plank→Fence/Trapdoor/Gate pipeline)  
  1. From A’s 240 planks: craft 208 planks into:  
     – 44 oak_fence  
     – 4 oak_fence_gate  
     – 16 oak_trapdoor  
     – retain 8 oak_planks as raw blocks  
  2. Craft sticks as needed in-line (plank → sticks → fence/gate)  

Parallelization tip: A strips while B crafts → switch to help once one queue empties.  

3. BUILD EXECUTION (Critical Path)  
Milestone 1 (t=0–30s):  
• C establishes footprint + scaffolding grid;  
• A & B at resource area.  
Milestone 2 (t=30–90s):  
• A finishes log haul → moves to processing;  
• B finishes lanters/chains/peonies/stairs haul → moves to processing;  
• C marks vertical post locations.  
Milestone 3 (t=90–180s):  
• A delivers 20 stripped_oak_wood → C places all “post” pillars;  
• B delivers fences/gates/trapdoors/planks + lanterns/chains + peonies + stairs to build site.  
Milestone 4 (t=180s–finish):  
Team splits into zones on the same scaffold level:  
  – Zone 1 (Posts & Frames): A installs oak_fence, oak_fence_gate between posts.  
  – Zone 2 (Openings & Hinges): B installs oak_trapdoors (orientations) and hangs lanterns via chains.  
  – Zone 3 (Roof & Trim): C installs all nether_brick_stairs in orientation order and places peony lower+upper.

4. TEAM COORDINATION  
• Radio “Milestone X reached” at each handoff point.  
• Carry a few extra sticks/planks in secondary slots to avoid mid-build trips.  
• Assign a “floater” role switch after Zone 1 finishes: redeploy helper to slowest zone.  
• Final sweep: 1 player checks alignment, 1 checks counts, 1 places any stragglers.

Key checkpoints:  
– Resource haul complete → call “Haul Done”  
– Processing pipeline complete → call “Ready to Build”  
– Pillars placed → call “Pillars Up”  
– Decorations hung + stairs in place → call “Detailing Done”  
– Final check → call “Structure 7 Complete”  

With strict adherence to these roles and milestones—and aggressive parallel processing—you’ll minimize idle time, reduce round-trip distances, and hit sub-5-minute completion.

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
Player jc_cr – follow these steps without pause. Report in chat exactly when you hit each milestone.

1. RESOURCE COLLECTION (t 0–30s)

   • Success criteria: Inventory holds all 5 item groups above.  
   • On completion—type in chat: “Haul Done.”

2. PROCESSING WORKFLOW (t 30–90s)  
   • Move immediately to Processing Area at (–69.4, 66.0, –84.4).  
   • Step A: Strip 20 oak_logs → 20 stripped_oak_wood (use your netherite axe).  
     Success: 20 stripped_oak_wood in inventory.  
   • Step B: Craft remaining 60 oak_logs → 240 oak_planks.  
     Success: 240 oak_planks in inventory.  
   • Step C: From 240 oak_planks craft:  
     – 44 oak_fence  
     – 4 oak_fence_gate  
     – 16 oak_trapdoor  
     – leave 8 oak_planks raw

   • Erect scaffolding grid covering the foundation area.  
   • Mark and place all 20 stripped_oak_wood “posts” in the exact footprint.  
   • Success: 20 posts standing in correct grid positions.  
   • On completion—type in chat: “Pillars Up.”
