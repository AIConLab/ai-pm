==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Summary plan (3 players) — goal: minimize total time by parallelizing harvest, crafting, and placement. Distances: structure at -20.7, resource area +34.4 (≈55 blocks east), processing at -69.4 (≈49 blocks west). Start at the structure.

1) Roles (assign players quickly)
- P1 — East Harvester / Hauler: primary collector at resource area (east). Harvest assigned share of placed blocks (stairs, logs, lanterns, peonies). Deliver most materials to either structure (raw placeables) or processing (raw logs).
- P2 — East Harvester / Builder: partner harvester who immediately starts placing pre-made blocks at structure (nether_brick_stairs, lanterns, peonies). Also delivers logs to processing when empty-handed.
- P3 — Processor / Core Crafter + Floater Builder: goes immediately to processing area (west) to receive logs, strip logs to produce stripped_oak_wood, craft planks / sticks / fences / gates / trapdoors, and hand finished items to P2 for placement. P3 will join P2 at structure late in round to finish detailed placement (trapdoors, fence-gates).

2) Resource collection priorities and sequence
Immediate pickup (no processing required):
- Nether_brick_stairs x48 (high-count, high-place time) — split harvest between P1 and P2 to cut break time in half.
- Lanterns x12 — split or all to whoever finishes stairs fastest.
- Peonies x8 — split or one player picks up all.
- Any pre-made non-wood blocks present (none else required).

Must-process items:
- Oak logs (source for planks and for stripped wood). Required raw calculation:
  - Stripped oak wood required: 20
  - Planks required (including for fences, trapdoors, gates, and explicit 8): ≈142 planks → ~36 logs
  - Total recommended oak_logs to harvest: 56 logs (carry ~60 as buffer)
Collection sequencing to minimize trips:
- On “go”, P1 & P2 sprint east. Divide the resource-area blockset:
  - P1 harvests ~half the logs (~28) + half of stairs (~24) + some lanterns/peonies.
  - P2 harvests the other half logs (~28) + other half stairs (~24) + remaining lanterns/peonies.
- As soon as P1 or P2 has enough placeables (stairs/lanterns/peonies), they return to structure to start placement (no processing).
- At least one stack of logs (all remaining logs) should be brought to processing area ASAP (P3 positioned there). Ideally P1 drops ~30 logs at processing; P2 delivers the rest. This splits travel and prevents queueing.

Inventory management specifics
- Stairs, lanterns, peonies and logs are all stackable; each harvester can carry large percentages in 1–3 slots. Use off-hand only for nothing critical.
- Carry only what you will place or hand to P3; avoid carrying crafted wood items that P3 must produce.
- Keep one hotbar slot free for the netherite axe (to strip if needed) and one for building block stack in each builder.

3) Processing workflow (P3 primary)
Materials requiring processing: oak_logs → planks (craft) and oak_logs → stripped_oak_wood (axe strip).
Order and timing to minimize idle time:
- Step 0 (immediate): P3 positions at processing area, opens crafting table, readies netherite axe.
- Step 1 (strip): As soon as first log batch arrives, P3 strips exactly 20 logs into stripped_oak_wood by right-clicking with the netherite axe (fast). Put stripped logs in one inventory slot reserved for delivery to structure.
  - Why first? Stripping is a quick operation and provides the exact blocks that cannot be crafted. Do this while no heavy crafting is happening.
- Step 2 (planks): Convert the remaining logs to planks. Do log -> 4 planks craft operations in batches (crafting table). Convert planks into required sticks while producing the planks stack.
- Step 3 (fence production): Produce fence batches. Use the standard batch plan:
  - Craft sticks from planks (1 plank -> 2 sticks) as needed.
  - Craft fence batches (15 batches → 45 fences; craft one extra batch to reach 44 required).
- Step 4 (trapdoors & gates): Craft trapdoor batches (9 batches → 18 trapdoors; one extra allowed) and 4 fence gate crafts.
- Step 5 (inventory consolidation): Consolidate crafted fences, trapdoors, gates and surplus planks into as few stacks as possible and pass to P2 (builder) immediately. P3 keeps the stripped logs (20) ready.

Parallelization in processing:
- P3 crafts continuously. P1/P2 deliver logs in staggered timings so P3 never runs dry.
- While P3 crafts, P2 is placing site-critical blocks (stairs, major frame). P3 hands off finished fence stacks to P2 in small batches so P2 can keep building without waiting.

4) Build execution sequence — fastest route to completion
Principles: Build largest, orientation-independent blocks first (stairs) while complex, orientation-specific items are being produced. Work from the skeleton outward.

Suggested sequence (concurrent):
- Phase A — Skeleton (P1 & P2):
  - 1) Place all nether_brick_stairs first (48). Split stairs placement between P1 and P2 by area (e.g., east half vs west half or top vs bottom) to avoid obstruction.
  - 2) Hang/place lanterns as you build the stair/roof skeleton (lanterns require a block above to hang—place where possible as structure geometry allows). P2 places lanterns as soon as their supporting block is in place.
  - 3) Place peonies/flower details last on floral positions once base blocks are set (small immediate tasks).
- Phase B — Fence/trapdoors/fence gates (P2 with supply from P3):
  - 1) As P3 supplies fence stacks, P2 places fence runs and gates per blueprint (44 fences, 4 gates). Build fences in contiguous runs—one batch at a time—so placements are continuous.
  - 2) Place trapdoors (17) and the one top trapdoor special-case at the end (it’s a different half/orientation).
- Phase C — Stripped wood delivery and installation (P3 hands off):
  - P3 delivers stripped_oak_wood x20 to P2 for placement where required. P2 uses these to finish the wooden detail work.
- Phase D — Final check & small fixes:
  - One player does a quick sweep against blueprint to fix any orientation mistakes (trapdoors/gates orientation) — this should be <10–20s if done immediately.

Critical path identification
- Resource breaking time (logs & stairs) is significant — split between P1 & P2.
- Crafting fences/trapdoors/gates is the other bottleneck because all wood-based decorative items come from crafting. P3 must be kept fed with logs and should not idle.
- Placing many fences and trapdoors is time-consuming but can be overlapped with crafting; keep P2 continuously building while P3 crafts.

5) Player-by-player task allocation (concise)
- P1 — East Harvester A (collection + partial placement)
  - Primary: Harvest ~half of stairs & logs. Bring ~30 logs to Processing immediately for P3.
  - Secondary: After drop-off, return to structure and place nether_brick_stairs (assigned segment).
  - Assist with lantern/peony placement as structure skeleton appears.

- P2 — East Harvester B (collection + main builder)
  - Primary: Harvest remaining logs & stairs; bring stairs and place the other half of stairs immediately at structure.
  - Main builder: Receive crafted fences/trapdoors/gates from P3 and place them continuously. Place stripped oak wood when P3 delivers it.
  - Final sweep and orientation checks.

- P3 — Processor / Crafter (processing hub)
  - Go straight to processing area; take netherite_axe and crafting table ready.
  - Receive logs from P1/P2; strip 20 logs immediately; then craft planks, sticks, fences, trapdoors, and gates in the calculated order.
  - Hand-off crafted stacks to P2 in small, frequent batches (avoid dropping everything at once).
  - Once crafting is mostly done, move to structure to help final placements and fixes.

6) Communication checkpoints & milestones (use quick callouts)
Use short verbal pings or one-key markers. Suggested times/target milestones to call:

- T+0 (start) — “GO”: P1/P2 to resource, P3 processing.
- M1 — “Raw 50%” (target 30–45s): half logs + half stairs harvested and first log stack delivered to processing. If missed, call “need logs now”.
- M2 — “Skeleton 50%” (target 1:00): 24 stairs placed + first 6 lanterns hung.
- M3 — “Stripped done” (target 1:00–1:15): P3 reports “stripped 20 done” and has given first batch of stripped wood to builder.
- M4 — “Fences streaming” (target 1:30): P3 has produced first fence batches; P2 receiving and placing fences without interruption.
- M5 — “Major placement complete” (target 2:00): all stairs, lanterns, peonies placed, 70–80% fences placed.
- M6 — “Finalize” (target 2:30): trapdoors, gates, and stripped wood placed; final sweep for orientations and missing blocks.
(Adjust times to actual round pacing; these are checkpoints to keep pressure and pacing.)

7) Small, practical speed tips
- Break blocks in diagonal rows (sprint between blocks) to reduce movement time when harvesting bulk placed blocks.
- P3 should craft in large continuous runs to avoid returning to empty-handed — stack output in inventory and hand over 10–12 fences at a time.
- Use hotbar slot mapping: 1 = building block being placed, 2 = fence stack, 3 = trapdoors, 4 = stripped wood, 5 = lanterns. Keep same mapping across team.
- Avoid unnecessary re-orientation delays: reserve one player (P2) to handle all orientation-sensitive placements (trapdoors/gates) to reduce mistakes.
- If a crafting backlog grows, P1 can join P3 at processing to help craft (two players using one table still speeds tasks by prepping inventory).

8) Quick resource list to harvest in priority order
1. Oak logs (target 56; bring to processing in two deliveries)
2. Nether_brick_stairs (48) — split harvest and place immediately
3. Lanterns (12)
4. Peonies (8)
5. (No smelting required; furnaces not used)

Wrap-up
- Keep P3 continuously fed with logs so crafting never stalls.
- P1/P2 should break and deliver blocks in balanced shares so no one is idle.
- Place the stairs and hang lanterns first (skeleton) — this yields visible progress and allows P3 to craft without blocking placement work.
- Aim to have stripping + crafting feeding placement such that P2 always has something to place; that is the true metric of flow.

If you want, I can convert this into a second-by-second timeline for a target run time (e.g., 2:30 target) with explicit movement times and number-of-block break estimates.

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr: GO now from structure position. Sprint east to resource area (~+34.4, ~55 blocks). Harvest target loads: collect 60 oak_logs (56 minimum), collect all nether_brick_stairs 48, lanterns 12, peonies 8. Prioritize grabbing and stacking all 48 stairs and lanterns first so you can start placing immediately; keep stairs in hotbar slot 1 and lanterns in slot 5. Use diagonal/sprint-breaking to cut movement time. Once you have at least 30 logs plus half the stairs/lanterns, run west through the structure to processing area (~-69.4) and drop 30 logs at the processing spot. Success check: processing has >=30 logs and you still carry ~24 stairs and some lanterns/peonies. At processing: equip netherite_axe in hotbar slot 1. Immediately strip exactly 20 logs into stripped_oak_wood and keep them consolidated in slot 4. Then convert remaining logs into planks to reach ~142 planks total, craft sticks as needed and produce 44 fences, 4 fence gates, and 18 trapdoors; consolidate outputs into as few stacks as possible. Success check: finished crafting with inventory containing 20 stripped_oak_wood, 44 fences, 4 gates, 18 trapdoors and spare planks for fixes. Hand off small batches for placement to yourself to avoid overburdening inventory (carry back 10–12 fences per trip, trapdoors/gates in small stacks). Return to structure and execute build sequence: place all 48 nether_brick_stairs first (work your way through a defined half of the build so you don't re-orient often). Hang lanterns as their supports appear and plant peonies last. As you receive crafted fences/trapdoors/gates, place fence runs and gates continuously (aim to place fences in contiguous runs). Place trapdoors (18) once fence skeletons are in place; place stripped_oak_wood (20) where marked. Maintain hotbar mapping: slot1=stairs, slot2=fences, slot3=trapdoors, slot4=stripped wood, slot5=lanterns. Milestones to self: M1 by ~0:45 deliver 30 logs to processing and have ~24 stairs carried/started. M2 by ~1:15 finish stripping 20 logs. M3 by ~1:45 begin steady fence placement from first crafted batch. M4 by ~2:30 aim for all stairs, lanterns, peonies placed and ~80% of fences done. Final sweep: check and correct trapdoor/gate orientations in one pass (<20s). If crafting backlog threatens progress, prioritize delivering remaining logs to processing before further placement so crafting never stalls. Communication: call short pings in chat "M1 done", "stripped done", "fences ready", "final sweep". End success criteria: structure matches blueprint with 48 stairs placed, 12 lanterns hung, 8 peonies planted, 44 fences and 4 gates installed, 18 trapdoors placed, and 20 stripped_oak_wood installed.
