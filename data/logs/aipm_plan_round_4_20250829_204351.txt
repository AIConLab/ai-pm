AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 4
Generated at: 20250829_204351
==================================================

1. Resource Collection Priorities  
- One-shot haul by Player 1 (P1):  
  • 25 iron_blocks (12 for build, 13 to convert)  
  • 19 orange_concrete_powder  
  • 4 redstone_torches  
- Carry all in one trip (3 stacks only), deliver immediately to Processing Area.

2. Processing Workflow & Timing  
- P1 delivers materials to Processing Area (target ≤ 30 s).  
- P2 at Processing Area begins:  
  a. Craft 13 iron_blocks → 117 iron_ingots (via crafting table) (~15 s)  
  b. Craft 27 iron_trapdoors (requires 108 ingots) – batch by type:  
     • 12 north, closed, unpowered  
     • 6 east, closed, unpowered  
     • 9 open & powered (1 south +4 east +4 west)  
     (~35 s total)  
  c. Craft 1 iron_door (6 ingots → 3 doors; use 2) (~2 s)  
  d. Convert 19 orange_concrete_powder → 19 orange_concrete on water source (~20 s)  
- P1 assists P2:  
  • Fetch remaining ingots/blocks if needed  
  • Organize chest slots by block type for quick pickup  
- By T+1:30, all processed items staged in chests at Processing Area.

3. Build Execution Sequence & Parallelization  
- Player 3 (P3) moves to Build Site as soon as first 12 iron_blocks + 12 north‐closed trapdoors are ready (~T+1:00).  
- Phase 1 (Foundation & Frame) [P3]:  
  • Place 12 iron_blocks per blueprint (T+1:00–T+2:30)  
- Phase 2 (Concrete Shell) [P3]:  
  • Install 19 orange_concrete elements (T+2:30–T+4:00)  
  • P2 continues crafting remaining trapdoors/powder conversion in parallel  
- Phase 3 (Closed Trapdoors “Windows”) [P3]:  
  • Fit 12 north‐closed + 6 east‐closed trapdoors into wall slots (T+4:00–T+5:00)  
- Phase 4 (Doors & Open/Painted Trapdoors) [P3]:  
  • Install lower & upper iron doors (2 hinges, facing north) (T+5:00–T+5:30)  
  • Fit 1 south‐open +4 east‐open +4 west‐open trapdoors around doors (T+5:30–T+6:00)  
- Phase 5 (Redstone Torches & Final Checks) [P3]:  
  • Place 4 lit redstone torches at indicated positions (T+6:00–T+6:30)  
  • Quick walk‐around correction, ensure waterlogged=false, powered=true where needed (T+6:30–T+7:00)

4. Team Coordination & Task Allocation  
- P1 (Runner/Assistant):  
  • T0–0:30: Resource haul → Processing Area  
  • T0:30–end: Assist P2 with crafting feeds, restock chest, carry processed batches to Build Site if P3 runs low  
- P2 (Processor):  
  • T0:30–1:30: Block-to-ingot conversion, trapdoor/door crafting, powder conversion  
  • T1:30–end: Re-supply P3 via P1 or direct handoff; inventory management in Processing chests  
- P3 (Builder):  
  • T1:00–T+7:00: Follow build sequence phases 1–5; call “needs” to P1/P2 at each phase boundary  

5. Key Milestones & Checkpoints  
- M1 (T+0:30): All raw materials at Processing Area  
- M2 (T+1:30): All processed blocks (trapdoors, doors, concrete) staged  
- M3 (T+2:30): Iron_block foundation complete  
- M4 (T+4:00): Orange_concrete shell complete  
- M5 (T+5:00): Closed trapdoors in place  
- M6 (T+6:00): Doors & open trapdoors installed  
- M7 (T+6:30): Redstone torches placed  
- M8 (T+7:00): Final QC & match blueprint exactly → Round complete  

Focus on tight handoffs between P1/P2, uninterrupted build by P3, and overlapping processing/build phases to hit the ~7-minute finish.
