==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
RESOURCE COLLECTION  
1. Iron Blocks & Bars (P1)  
 • Trip 1: Go to Resource [34,65,−84]  
 • Collect 7×iron_block (for structure) + 3×iron_block (for ingots)  
 • Collect all 6 orientation‐specific iron_bars  
 • Return to Processing [−69,66,−84], unload in shared chest  

2. Wool & Logs (P2)  
 • Trip 1: Go to Resource  
 • Collect 48×white_wool (for 8 banners)  
 • Collect 3×oak_log (to craft 16 planks → 8 sticks)  
 • Return to Processing, unload  

3. Bars & Buffer (optional P3 or shadow)  
 • If any bars/or blocks left, P3 picks up bars or extra wool on way to Processing  

PROCESSING WORKFLOW (P3 lead, overlap with P1/P2 return)  
1. Craft Iron Ingots  
 • At crafting_table: convert 3 iron_blocks → 27×iron_ingot  
2. Trapdoor Crafting  
 • Craft 6×iron_trapdoor (4 ingots each) → 24 ingots used  
3. Banner Blanks & Dye  
 • At crafting_table: logs → planks → sticks (3 logs → ~16 planks → >8 sticks)  
 • Craft 8 banner_blanks (6 wool + 1 stick each)  
 • Dye each blank with red_dye (from Processing chest) → 8×red_wall_banner  
4. Staging  
 • Place 7 iron_blocks, 6 trapdoors, 6 bars, 8 banners into a single bundle/chest  
 • All three meet up at Chest staging point  

BUILD EXECUTION PLAN (Structure @ [−20,65,−86])  
Divide and conquer by component type and structure quadrant. All start from staging chest at structure.

P1 (Block Layer)  
 • Milestone B1: Place 7 iron_blocks as base/frame  
 • Works continuously from Block 1→7 left→right  

P2 (Bar Layer)  
 • Milestone B2: Install all 6 iron_bars into pre‐set block slots  
 • Place in orientation order:  
   – EB & SB → both ends first  
   – NB & WB → middle crossbars  

P3 (Trapdoors & Banners)  
 • Milestone B3.1: Place 6 iron_trapdoors  
   – 4 east‐facing then north, south  
 • Milestone B3.2: Attach 8 red_wall_banners  
   – 2 each facing N, S, E, W  

CRITICAL PATH & PARALLELISM  
– P1’s block frame must complete before P2/P3 placement begins on each segment.  
– As soon as first 2–3 blocks are down, P2 can start bar placement on those, and P3 can hang trapdoors/banners in cleared sections.  
– Synchronize via voice cue: “Section A ready” → P2+P3 go  

TASK ALLOCATION SUMMARY  
– P1: exclusively gathering iron_blocks/bars then block placement  
– P2: gathering wool/logs + bar placement  
– P3: all processing tasks + trapdoor/banner placement  

KEY MILESTONES  
T0+0s – T0+10s: Resource bundles delivered to Processing  
T0+10s – T0+25s: Trapdoors & banners crafted, items staged at chest  
T0+25s – T0+30s: All at structure location, inventory distributed  
T0+30s – T0+50s: Block frame completed (7 blocks)  
T0+45s – T0+65s: Iron bars placed in parallel  
T0+60s – T0+75s: Trapdoors & banners installed; final check & match  

COMMUNICATION CHECKPOINTS  
– “Blocks down” → P2/P3 begin placements  
– “Bars done” → P3 finish banners/trapdoors  
– “Finish” → Verify pattern/orientations  

This plan minimizes trips (2 each), maximizes parallel build, and front‐loads crafting to eliminate downtime at the structure.

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr: You are executing P1, P2 and P3 in sequence. Follow these Milestones—no downtime, move straight from one to the next.

Trip 1 – Iron Blocks & Bars  
1. Walk to the Iron resource at 34 65 –84.  
2. Break/collect:  
   • 10 iron_block  
   • 6 iron_bars  
3. Return to Processing station at –69 66 –84.  
4. Deposit all into the shared chest.  
   Success: chest inventory shows exactly 10 iron_block + 6 iron_bar.

Trip 2 – Wool & Logs  
1. Walk to the Wool/Log resource at 32 65 –92.  
2. Collect:  
   • 48 white_wool  
   • 3 oak_log  
3. Return to Processing at –69 66 –84.  
4. Deposit all into the shared chest.  
   Success: chest inventory shows exactly 48 white_wool + 3 oak_log.

Milestone – Crafting & Staging (at Processing)  
A. Iron → Trapdoors  
 1. At the Crafting Table, pull exactly 3 iron_block from chest → craft 27 iron_ingot.  
 2. Use 24 iron_ingot → craft 6 iron_trapdoor.  
 3. Return any leftover ingots to chest (should be 3).

B. Logs/Wool → Banners  
 1. Pull 3 oak_log → craft them into planks → sticks (expect ≥8 sticks).  
 2. Pull 8 sticks + 48 white_wool → craft 8 banner_blank.  
 3. Pull 8 banner_blank + 8 red_dye from chest → craft 8 red_wall_banner.

C. Staging Chest Prep  
 1. In the Processing chest, create a new “Staging” bundle or place items together:  
    • 7 iron_block  
    • 6 iron_bar  
    • 6 iron_trapdoor  
    • 8 red_wall_banner  
 2. Confirm staging chest shows exactly those counts.

Milestone – Build Execution (Structure @ –20 65 –86)  
1. Carry all staged items to the Structure chest at –20 65 –86 and deposit.  
2. Equip: iron_blocks, iron_bars, iron_trapdoors, banners.

6. Final Check  
   • Walk all around structure; confirm block positions, bar orientations, trapdoor facings, banner directions match reference.  
   • Voice cue: “Finish.”  

Overall Success = Replica matches reference exactly, all items used up.
