AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 1

==================================================

Strategic Plan for Round 1 – Structure 1  

1. Resource Collection Priorities  
 • Oak stairs (x20): Requires 5 oak logs → 15 planks → 20 stairs (crafting)  
 • Light gray concrete (x25): 25 concrete powder → water conversion (processing)  
 • Iron bars (x5): Grab pre–made all-false variant from Resource Area  

2. Player Task Assignment  
 Player A – Concrete Specialist & Bar Runner  
  • Run to Resource Area → pick up 25 light_gray_concrete_powder + 5 iron_bars  
  • Carry powder to Processing Area → convert to 25 concrete blocks at water block  
  • Deliver first batch of concrete blocks to Builder; then fetch bars and deliver when needed  

 Player B – Wood/Stairs Specialist  
  • Run to Resource Area → pick up 5 oak_logs  
  • Deliver logs to Processing Area → use Crafting Table:  
     – Logs → planks (4 planks/log → 20 planks)  
     – Planks → oak_stairs (3 planks → 4 stairs; repeat 5×)  
  • Deliver oak_stairs in two dumps (10+10) to Builder as soon as ready  

 Player C – Builder & Coordinator  
  • Immediately run to Structure site → place scaffolding, orient compass to blueprint  
  • Receive incoming materials and begin construction without pause  
  • Coordinate placement, call for next batch of resources  

3. Processing Timeline (overlaps heavily)  
 T 0–10s  
  • A arrives with powder → starts converting at water block (25 powder → 25 blocks)  
  • B arrives with logs → crafts planks then stairs (20 stairs total)  
  • C arrives on-site → readies build area (scaffolding, reference check)  

 T 10–20s  
  • A finishes concrete → grabs a stack of 12 blocks → runs to Builder  
  • B finishes stairs → grabs first 10 stairs → runs to Builder  
  • C receives 12 concrete → begins laying foundation pattern  

 T 20–30s  
  • A returns for bars or remaining concrete (13 blocks)  
  • B delivers remaining 10 stairs  
  • C continues foundation and starts edge detail with delivered stairs  

 T 30–45s  
  • C completes concrete core (25 blocks)  
  • C installs oak_stairs around perimeter as per blueprint  
  • A delivers 5 iron_bars → C installs them in final positions  

4. Build Execution Sequence & Critical Path  
 1. Foundation (25 concrete) – critical path, must start with first 12 blocks  
 2. Perimeter detail (20 oak stairs) – immediately as soon as first stairs arrive  
 3. Iron-bar accents (5) – last, very quick once placed in slots  

 Parallelism:  
 • A & B process materials simultaneously  
 • C builds in 3 mini-phases as resources trickle in  

5. Key Milestones & Checkpoints  
 M1 (10s): C has first 12 concrete blocks down in correct pattern  
 M2 (20s): C has 10 stairs installed on one side, foundation half done  
 M3 (30s): Foundation fully laid; stairs ongoing; last concrete delivered  
 M4 (40s): All stairs in place; A drops off iron bars  
 M5 (45s): Final iron bars installed; structure matches reference → finish  

Communication Cues  
 • A→C “12 concrete ready”  
 • B→C “10 stairs ready”  
 • C→A “need bars now”  
 • Continuous status (“foundation done,” “stairs done,” “bars done”)  

With tight overlap of processing and building, this plan targets sub-60s completion.
