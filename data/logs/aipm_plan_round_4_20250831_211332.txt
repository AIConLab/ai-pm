AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 4
Generated at: 20250831_211332
==================================================

Note: strategy assumes a full 3-player team. Current single-player status (jc_cr) will be grossly slower — recruit two teammates or follow the same tasks solo with many more trips.

High-level summary
- Critical path = convert iron blocks → ingots → craft 27 iron trapdoors + iron door (crafting) and placement + converting 19 orange concrete powder → 19 orange concrete (water). Start processing immediately; builders place large blocks in parallel so finishing (trapdoors/torches) is the last step. Minimize back-and-forth by carrying as many iron blocks and concrete powder as possible each trip.

1) Resource collection priorities (what to grab now)
- Immediate (high priority)
  - Iron blocks: total needed = 12 placed in the build + additional blocks for ingot conversion to craft trapdoors & door.
    - Ingots required: 114 (108 for 27 trapdoors, 6 for iron door).
    - Blocks → ingots conversion: ceil(114 / 9) = 13 iron blocks to convert.
    - Total iron blocks to take from resource area = 12 (to place) + 13 (to convert) = 25 iron_blocks.
- Medium priority
  - Orange concrete powder: 19 (convert to orange_concrete blocks at processing water).
  - Redstone torches: 4 (appear in blueprint and can be used to power the trapdoors/door).
- Low priority / none
  - No smelting from ore required; no other materials required from lists.

Optimal collection sequence to minimize trips
- All players sprint to the resource area immediately.
- Split haul:
  - Hauler A: take 13 iron_blocks (for conversion) → go straight to processing area.
  - Hauler B: take 12 iron_blocks (final blocks) + a partial load of orange concrete powder (e.g., 10) → go straight to the build site and begin placing iron blocks as soon as they arrive.
  - Hauler C: take remaining orange concrete powder (rest of 19) + 4 redstone torches → go to processing area for concrete conversion then deliver concrete blocks to build site.
- Inventory note: iron_blocks stack to 64 so each player can carry many at once; a single trip per player is feasible.

2) Processing workflow (what must be done, when, who)
Materials requiring processing
- Iron blocks → ingots (crafting table converts block → 9 ingots).
- Ingots → iron trapdoors & iron door (crafting table).
- Orange concrete powder → orange concrete (touch water or drop onto water source).

Processing order & timing (parallelize)
- Highest priority processing: iron block → ingots → craft trapdoors & iron door. This is the critical path because trapdoors must be placed last and must be ready for final wiring.
- Secondary processing: convert orange concrete powder → concrete (fast, can be done in one or two batches at the water in processing area).
- Recommended sequence:
  1. Hauler A (Processor) immediately put 13 iron_blocks onto the crafting table and convert to ingots (use shift-click to make all ingots at once). Then craft all 27 trapdoors and the iron door pieces. Stash crafted trapdoors/door in inventory or a chest at processing for quick distribution.
  2. Hauler C (Concrete converter) place a water source at the processing water block and convert all 19 powder to concrete quickly (drop powder onto water or place above water). Pick up solid concrete blocks.
  3. If time permits, Processor can craft trapdoors first then assist moving concrete to build site.
- Player assignment for processing:
  - Processor (P3): full responsibility for iron conversions and crafting all trapdoors & iron door. Deliver trapdoors to builders ASAP.
  - Concrete converter (P2): convert all 19 powders to concrete, deliver to builders.
  - Builders (P1 & P2): start placing large blocks as soon as they have blocks.

3) Build execution plan (fastest construction sequence)
Principles:
- Place big, static blocks first to create the full shell (iron_blocks and orange concrete) while processing is running.
- Do not place trapdoors/doors/torches until their crafted pieces are ready — they are finishing pieces and require correct power states.
- Place trapdoors/doors last and apply powering elements (redstone torches) to set open/powered states.

Concrete build sequence
- Step 1 (parallel): P1 begins placing the 12 iron_blocks at their required positions (skeleton frame). P2 simultaneously places orange concrete blocks in their areas as they get deliveries from P2 (or P3 after conversion).
- Step 2: Finish all heavy block placements (iron & orange). Use scaffolding from processing area if needed (scaffolding exists in processing area).
- Step 3 (finishing - critical path): Once P3 finishes crafting trapdoors + iron door:
  - Distribute trapdoors and iron door to builders.
  - Builders place trapdoors in their exact orientations. For trapdoors that must be open=true powered=true, the builder places them, then P3 or P2 places the redstone torch(s) in the exact adjacent spot to power them (use the 4 redstone torches both as blueprint items and power sources).
  - Place the iron door and power it (redstone torch or power on adjacent block).
- Step 4: Final check to match all open/closed and powered/unpowered states exactly.

Parallel work opportunities
- While Processor crafts trapdoors, two builders place iron_blocks and orange concrete simultaneously.
- Concrete conversion can occur in parallel with trapdoor crafting.
- Once trapdoors are made, P3 can hand them to builders; one builder places all east/west/north closed trapdoors while the other handles open/powered ones and torches.

Critical path
- Crafting the 27 trapdoors + iron door (requires converting iron blocks → ingots → many craft operations). Ensure this starts immediately and gets prioritized over non-critical tasks.
- All other tasks (concrete conversion and block placement) are parallelizable and shorter.

4) Team coordination & exact player assignments
Suggested assignments (3 players: P1, P2, P3)

- P1 — Builder / Iron Hauler
  - Trip: resource area → grab 12 iron_blocks (final) → go to build site.
  - Role: place all 12 iron_blocks immediately in correct positions (skeleton). Mark trapdoor/door locations visually so finishing is faster.
  - After placing iron_blocks, help place some orange concrete blocks and assist final trapdoor placement.

- P2 — Concrete Converter / Builder 2
  - Trip: resource area → grab orange_concrete_powder (all 19) + redstone_torches (4) → go to processing area.
  - At processing: convert all powder to concrete using the water source and pick up concrete blocks.
  - Deliver orange concrete blocks to P1 at build site and place them in assigned areas while P3 crafts trapdoors.
  - After trapdoors are ready, help place trapdoors and place the redstone torches to power them.

- P3 — Processor / Crafter (critical)
  - Trip: resource area → grab 13 iron_blocks (for conversion) [and optionally a few extra if redundancy needed] → go immediately to processing area.
  - Use crafting table to convert 13 blocks → 117 ingots (shift-click).
  - Craft 27 trapdoors and the iron door (craft iron door from 6 ingots; generates 3 doors — use 1).
  - Keep trapdoors/door in inventory or chest at processing; deliver to builders as soon as a batch is finished (do in one batch if possible).
  - If spare time, help transport trapdoors to builders and place redstone torches to power/open required trapdoors.

Communication checkpoints (short, concrete radio-style calls)
- “T=0 — START: everyone to resource area” (when match starts)
- “Iron blocks split: P1 = 12 (to build), P3 = 13 (to processing). P2 = powders + torches.”
- “P3 crafting started — trapdoors ETA [call when done]”
- “P1/P2 block placement 50% done” (midway)
- “Trapdoors ready — handing off” (P3)
- “Finishing: placing trapdoors & torches — final check in 10s”
- “Done? final compare — confirm all opened/powered states” (final checkpoint)

Milestones (for progress tracking)
- M0 (start): All players leave spawn → resource area.
- M1 (T+short): All required raw materials gathered and in position:
  - P3 at processing with 13 iron_blocks
  - P1 at build site with 12 iron_blocks
  - P2 at processing with powder + 4 redstone_torches
- M2 (processing done): P3 finishes all trapdoor & door crafting (deliver to builders). P2 finishes concrete conversion and begins delivery to build site.
- M3 (structure shell complete): All iron_blocks and orange concrete blocks placed (builders call “shell complete”).
- M4 (finishing): All trapdoors/door placed in correct orientations and powered states set with torches.
- M5 (final check): One player performs quick reference compare (walkthrough) and calls “match” then present for validation.

Practical tips to speed up
- Shift-clicking on crafting table for block→ingots and batch trapdoor crafting is vital — teach the crafter to shift-click to output full stacks at once.
- Place a small chest at processing to stage crafted trapdoors + concrete so builders can pull while still building.
- Builders should not attempt to craft trapdoors/doors themselves — craft centrally (P3) to avoid duplication and wasted time.
- When powering trapdoors, place torches on the block face that will reliably power the trapdoor hinge side; plan these torch placements ahead while shelving block layout.
- If only one player is present (jc_cr), follow the same role order but expect 4–6× the time; prioritize converting all iron blocks first, then concrete, then place blocks, then finish with trapdoors.

Concise checklist to execute immediately (first 60 seconds)
1. Everyone sprint to resource area.
2. P1 picks 12 iron_blocks → to build site.
3. P3 picks 13 iron_blocks → to processing table → convert to ingots → craft all trapdoors & iron door.
4. P2 picks 19 orange_concrete_powder + 4 redstone_torches → to processing water → convert → deliver concrete to build site.
5. P1 & P2 place all iron and orange blocks in parallel.
6. P3 delivers trapdoors → P1/P2 place trapdoors and torches to get correct open/powered states → final check.
