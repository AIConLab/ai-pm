AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 10
Generated at: 20250831_001006
==================================================

Resource Collection (one synchronized round‐trip to the resource area)  
  • Player 1 → iron_block ×9  
  • Player 2 → iron_bars ×6  
  • Player 3 → iron_trapdoor ×6 & red_wall_banner ×8  
    – (If trapdoors/banners are not pre-crafted: Player 3 grabs 2 extra iron_blocks + stick/dye materials, hauls them to the Processing Area, crafts 6 trapdoors and 8 banners on a single furnace/crafting-table cycle, then heads to the Structure.)  
  • Departure window: all three leave spawn ≤5 s apart → gather in ≤15 s total  

Processing Workflow  
  • Ideally none (all items pre-crafted).  
  • Fallback (if raw materials only):  
    – P3 hauls 2 iron_blocks → Processing Area (≈20 s travel), crafts 18 iron_ingots in blast furnace (30 s), crafts 6 trapdoors (1×crafting table), dyes/wool → 8 banners in parallel.  
    – Total P3 processing time ≈60 s. Meanwhile P1&P2 head straight to the Structure with their loads.  

Build Execution Sequence (at Structure)  
  1. Foundation & shell (P1)  
     • Lay out 7 iron_blocks in the exact footprint; build up walls to required height.  
     • Target time: 30 s  
  2. Iron bars installation (P2)  
     • Pre-stage bars on ground perimeter, then place in designated block holes/orientations.  
     • Can begin as soon as the first ring of blocks is in place.  
     • Target time: 20 s  
  3. Banners & trapdoors (P3)  
     • As soon as adjacent block faces are available, affix wall banners in correct facing order (N×2, W×2, E×2, S×2), then snap in trapdoors (E×4, N×1, S×1).  
     • Target time: 20 s  

Critical Path & Parallelism  
  • P1’s block frame unlocks P2’s bars  
  • P2’s bars unlock P3’s banners/trapdoors  
  • Total build overlap: ~70 s  

Player Task Allocation  
  • P1 (Frame Specialist): iron_blocks → Structure → build shell  
  • P2 (Bar Specialist): iron_bars → Structure → install bars as soon as blocks permit  
  • P3 (Detail Specialist): trapdoors & banners → Structure → place decorative/functional elements  

Communication Checkpoints & Milestones  
  T+0 s: Depart spawn  
  T+15 s: All items in inventory; depart resource (or P3 departs Processing if needed)  
  T+45 s: P1&P2 arrive Structure; P1 begins foundation, P2 stages bars  
  T+75 s: Foundation complete → P2 places bars, P3 arrives with details  
  T+95 s: Bars complete → P3 places banners/trapdoors  
  T+115 s: Final check vs. blueprint → submit  

By funneling all resource collection into a single synchronized trip, pipelining any minor processing solely on Player 3, and overlapping build phases as soon as dependencies clear, total round time is minimized.
