AIPM Player Instructions - Round 1

==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan – Round 1, Structure 1 (3 Players)

1. Resource Collection Priorities  
  • Oak stairs (20 total – 5 each facing N/E/S/W) ⇒ craft from oak logs  
  • Light gray concrete (25) ⇒ convert from light_gray_concrete_powder  
  • Iron bars (5 neutral-orientation) ⇒ grab directly  

2. Mini-Processing Station Setup (Role A)  
  – Starting at Processing Area (–69, 66, –84):  
    • Collect 1 crafting_table + 1 empty bucket → fill at water ([level=0]).  
    • Carry crafting_table + water_bucket to Build Site (–20, 65, –86).  
    • Place table & water block to serve as on-site “processing hub.”  

3. Bulk Material Haul (Role B)  
  – From Resource Area (34, 65, –83):  
    • 8 oak_logs (yields 32 planks → 20 stairs)  
    • 25 light_gray_concrete_powder  
    • 5 iron_bars ([east=false,…])  
    • (Optional backup: 10 scaffolding for reach)  
  – Deliver all to Build Site’s mini-station in one trip.  

4. On-Site Processing Workflow  
  – Role A at the mini-station:  
    1. Craft oak_logs → planks → stairs (6 planks→4 stairs, repeat) → stash 20 stairs.  
    2. Toss powder into water → pick up 25 light_gray_concrete.  
  – Role B assists: unload and organize finished blocks in two neat 5× stacks (stairs by facing).  

5. Build Execution Sequence & Parallelism  
  • Layout & Foundation (both Builders):  
    – Mark 5×5 footprint with concrete on the ground.  
    – Install 5 iron_bars in pre-designated row (structural inset)  
  • Stairs Installation (Player C joins as “Floater”):  
    – Divide four sides: each builder places two sides (5 stairs each) in parallel.  
    – Final side by Floater while others QA.  
  • Always build from back→front (north→south) to avoid obstruction.  

6. Task Assignment  
  Role A (Processing & Staging):  
    – Station setup, crafting stairs, converting concrete, handing off materials.  
  Role B (Hauler & Foundation):  
    – Single-trip haul of logs, powder, bars → sets initial concrete layout & bars.  
  Role C (Builder & QA):  
    – Marks footprint, guides bar placement, splits stair-sides with Role B, final QC.  

7. Key Milestones & Timing (Target: ~8 min total)  
  M1 (0:00–1:00) – Role A fetches station gear; Roles B/C transit to Resource/Build.  
  M2 (1:00–2:30) – Haul complete; mini-station placed; layout marked.  
  M3 (2:30–4:30) – All 20 stairs & 25 concrete processed & staged.  
  M4 (4:30–6:00) – Foundation & iron bars installed.  
  M5 (6:00–7:30) – Stairs placed on three sides (2 builders in parallel).  
  M6 (7:30–8:00) – Final side & QA → Structure completion.  

Communication Checkpoints  
  – “Station up” (M1 end) → role-shift confirmation  
  – “Materials ready” (M3) → kickoff foundation  
  – “Bars in” (M4) → begin stairs  
  – “Stairs done” → final QC & timer stop  

Notes on Speed Optimization  
  • One-trip haul minimizes lookup & travel.  
  • On-site processing eliminates back-and-forth.  
  • Parallel side-by-side stair placement halves that segment’s time.  
  • Pre-mark footprint prevents mid-build measuring.

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
BT1013 – Role B (Hauler & Foundation Prep)  
• Sprint to Resource Area at (34, 65, –83). In one trip, collect:  
  – 8 oak_logs  
  – 25 light_gray_concrete_powder  
  – 5 iron_bars (neutral orientation)  
  – Optional if you see them: 10 scaffolding  
• Return directly to Build Site at (–20, 65, –86) by the mini-station spot.  
• Unload into two neat stacks on the ground:  
  – Stack 1: 8 oak_logs  
  – Stack 2: 25 concrete_powder + 5 iron_bars (+ scaffolding if taken)  
• Success = all items in stacks at (–20, 65, –86) within 60 seconds.

jc_cr – Role A (Processing Station Setup)  
• Move to Processing Area at (–69, 66, –84).  
• From the chests/crafting nook, grab:  
  – 1 crafting_table  
  – 1 empty_bucket  
• Walk to the nearest water source (y = 0), fill the bucket.  
• Carry both items back to Build Site at (–20, 65, –86).  
• At exactly these coords, place:  
  – Crafting Table at (–21, 65, –86)  
  – Water Block at (–20, 65, –86) (use the filled bucket)  
• Type “Station up” in chat as soon as both blocks are placed.  
• Success = mini-station fully assembled and confirmed by “Station up” within 60 seconds.

Once both “Station up” and BT1013’s haul stacks are in place (M1 end), we’ll shift to processing & foundation tasks.
