AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 4
Generated at: 20250831_210319
==================================================

Summary (goal): fastest completion by minimizing long trips (resource <-> processing ~100+ blocks). Key bottleneck = crafting many iron trapdoors/door (single crafting table). Parallelize collection + on-site building while one player crafts trapdoors continuously.

Quick counts & conversion plan
- Required final pieces:
  - Iron blocks (placed as blocks): 12
  - Iron trapdoors (various states): 27 total
  - Iron door (1 door = 2 block entries in blueprint)
  - Orange concrete: 19
  - Redstone torches: 4
- Crafting math (planning cushion):
  - Trapdoors + door need ~114 iron ingots (estimate using 4 ingots/trapdoor + 6 ingots for a door). That requires 13 iron blocks → 13 * 9 = 117 ingots.
  - Total iron blocks to TAKE from resource: 12 (final) + 13 (to convert to ingots) = 25 iron_blocks.
  - Take 19 orange_concrete_powder (convert to 19 orange_concrete).
  - Take 4 redstone_torches.

1) Resource collection priorities (who grabs what first)
- Player A (Crafter / Processor runner)
  - Collect 13 iron_blocks → run to Processing area immediately.
  - Grab a bucket from Processing if needed (processing area has bucket). If not, grab bucket from processing on arrival.
- Player B (Primary Builder / Iron-block carrier)
  - Collect 12 iron_blocks (final placement blocks).
  - Collect scaffolding from Processing if needed (processing has scaffolding).
  - Bring iron_blocks directly to STRUCTURE location and start skeleton/frame work.
- Player C (Concrete specialist / Runner)
  - Collect 19 orange_concrete_powder and 4 redstone_torches.
  - Bring powders to Processing to convert into orange_concrete (using water there), then carry concrete to Structure.
Notes on trip minimization:
- Each player should try to complete their resource pickup in one trip. All stacks are small (≤64) so one inventory slot is sufficient for each block type. Carry other small items (torches, scaffolding) in free slots.
- Resource → Processing → Structure forms a line. Avoid shuttling back to resource once you have required counts.

2) Processing workflow (order & timing)
- Immediate setup at Processing (first second one) — Player A:
  1. Place 13 iron_blocks on crafting table(s) to get 117 iron_ingots. Do this immediately and continuously. This is the critical path.
  2. Start crafting iron_trapdoors and the iron_door as soon as enough ingots available. Keep output in inventory or chest at Processing for pick-up by builders.
  3. Convert orange_concrete_powder to orange_concrete (Player C does this): set down a 1×2 water station or use bucket: place water, drop powder into contact → becomes concrete. Convert all 19 at once, then pick up the 19 concrete pieces.
- Parallelization:
  - While Player A crafts, Player B and C are moving blocks to the structure and beginning placements that do not require trapdoors/door.
  - Player A should prioritize making trapdoors in the order needed by build sequence (e.g., produce closed/unpowered ones first if those are placed earlier).
- Processing tips:
  - Use the chest at Processing to stage finished trapdoors/concrete for quick pickup.
  - Keep one slot free for finished trapdoors so builders can grab small stacks and move out quickly.
  - Player A must craft continuously; minimize switching from crafting to other tasks.

3) Build execution plan (fastest sequence & critical path)
Critical path = create all trapdoors + iron door (single crafting table). Non-critical tasks (can be done while crafting happens) = placing iron_blocks and orange_concrete.

Suggested construction sequence (3-player parallel):
- Phase 1 — Rough frame (Players B + C)
  - Player B places the 12 iron_blocks and begins majority of block placements that don't need trapdoors.
  - Player C places converted orange_concrete for large contiguous areas (19 blocks).
  - Use scaffolding to speed movement/placement; reuse scaffolding rather than placing/removing blocks.
- Phase 2 — Trapdoor/door installation (Player A output + Player B/C placements)
  - As Player A finishes batches of trapdoors, they or a builder carry them to Structure and place them in their required positions.
  - Place trapdoors in closed/unpowered positions first (12 north closed, 6 east closed) as those are static; then place the powered/open ones and apply redstone_torches to set their powered/open state.
  - Iron door: place lower and upper halves and position a redstone_torch (or power source) to set door powered/open state.
- Phase 3 — Powering & verification
  - Place 4 redstone_torches at the exact positions specified in blueprint to produce powered=true/lit=true states for the 4 redstone_torch blocks themselves and to power trapdoors/door as required.
  - Small adjustments: rotate trapdoors/door orientation when placing to match facing/hinge states − builders must place while standing at the correct side.

Parallel opportunities
- While Player A is crafting, Players B+C should be building all non-trapdoor areas and staging for trapdoor installation (clear placement points, scaffold, position torches).
- When Player A finishes a chest of trapdoors, both B and C can pause block placement to install a full batch quickly; then resume.

4) Team coordination (assignments, communication, milestones)
Assignments (3-player):
- Player A: Crafter/Processor lead — responsible for: converting iron_blocks to ingots, crafting trapdoors and door, converting concrete ONLY if C delayed, staging outputs in Processing chest.
- Player B: Structural builder — responsible for: picking up and placing the 12 iron_blocks, building the frame and structural placements, placing iron-trapdoor mounting points when trapdoors arrive.
- Player C: Concrete & torch specialist + runner — responsible for: collecting/ converting orange_concrete, collecting 4 redstone torches, carrying concrete to Structure, placing orange_concrete, placing redstone_torches to power trapdoors/door when instructed.

Communication checkpoints (short, clearly called)
- “Processing up” — Player A: processing started, iron ingot conversion in progress.
- “Concrete ready” — Player C: orange concrete converted and on way to structure.
- “Trapdoors batch ready X” — Player A: announces number ready (e.g., “Batch 1: 12 trapdoors ready”) so Player B/C pause and install them immediately.
- “Need more iron blocks” — any player calls if they realize counts were insufficient.
- “Power ready” — when torches placed to set powered/open states.
- “Final check” — once all pieces placed; run quick visual scan for block states (open/closed/powered/face) and call “Done”.

Milestones (time-ordered)
1. T0–0:20s — All players at resource/processing assigned; Player A starts ingot conversion immediately.
2. T0–1:00 — Player B/C complete resource pickup and begin structure framing and concrete conversion.
3. T1–? — First trapdoor batch produced (Player A): deliver to structure; builders install immediately.
4. Mid-build — 50% of static blocks placed (iron_blocks + concrete). Most trapdoors installed progressively as produced.
5. Final — Iron door installed and powered; redstone torches placed and verified; final verification & finish.

Inventory & slot recommendations (minimize trips)
- Player A (Crafter): keep ingots in stacks in chest; carry small stack of trapdoors in hotbar for immediate runouts to structure.
- Player B (Builder): hotbar = iron_blocks, scaffolding, placement tool (pickaxe), empty slot for trapdoors delivered.
- Player C (Concrete): hotbar = orange_concrete (converted), redstone_torches, scaffolding/blocks for temporary standing.

Extra optimizations
- Use a chest at Processing to stage finished trapdoors/concrete for builders to ferry in one quick trip rather than Player A making repeated runs.
- If only one crafting_table exists, minimize idle time by having Player A do continuous recipe repeats; set up an assembly-line: block → ingots → craft trapdoors → drop to chest → builders pick up.
- Place water conversion pad next to Processing chest to convert all concrete powder in one go.

If you have only one active player (jc_cr) right now
- Immediate recommended action: jc_cr should run to Processing area and start converting iron_blocks to ingots and set up water pad for concrete conversion. Stage outputs in Processing chests so that when teammates appear they can immediately start building with minimal setup.

If you want, I can convert this into a second-by-second script with exact travel legs and expected time splits (requires team walking speed assumptions).
