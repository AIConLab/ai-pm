AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 1

==================================================

Strategic Plan – Round 1, Structure 1 (3 Players)

1. Resource Collection Priorities  
  • Oak stairs (20 total – 5 each facing N/E/S/W) ⇒ craft from oak logs  
  • Light gray concrete (25) ⇒ convert from light_gray_concrete_powder  
  • Iron bars (5 neutral-orientation) ⇒ grab directly  

2. Mini-Processing Station Setup (Role A)  
  – Starting at Processing Area (–69, 66, –84):  
    • Collect 1 crafting_table + 1 empty bucket → fill at water ([level=0]).  
    • Carry crafting_table + water_bucket to Build Site (–20, 65, –86).  
    • Place table & water block to serve as on-site “processing hub.”  

3. Bulk Material Haul (Role B)  
  – From Resource Area (34, 65, –83):  
    • 8 oak_logs (yields 32 planks → 20 stairs)  
    • 25 light_gray_concrete_powder  
    • 5 iron_bars ([east=false,…])  
    • (Optional backup: 10 scaffolding for reach)  
  – Deliver all to Build Site’s mini-station in one trip.  

4. On-Site Processing Workflow  
  – Role A at the mini-station:  
    1. Craft oak_logs → planks → stairs (6 planks→4 stairs, repeat) → stash 20 stairs.  
    2. Toss powder into water → pick up 25 light_gray_concrete.  
  – Role B assists: unload and organize finished blocks in two neat 5× stacks (stairs by facing).  

5. Build Execution Sequence & Parallelism  
  • Layout & Foundation (both Builders):  
    – Mark 5×5 footprint with concrete on the ground.  
    – Install 5 iron_bars in pre-designated row (structural inset)  
  • Stairs Installation (Player C joins as “Floater”):  
    – Divide four sides: each builder places two sides (5 stairs each) in parallel.  
    – Final side by Floater while others QA.  
  • Always build from back→front (north→south) to avoid obstruction.  

6. Task Assignment  
  Role A (Processing & Staging):  
    – Station setup, crafting stairs, converting concrete, handing off materials.  
  Role B (Hauler & Foundation):  
    – Single-trip haul of logs, powder, bars → sets initial concrete layout & bars.  
  Role C (Builder & QA):  
    – Marks footprint, guides bar placement, splits stair-sides with Role B, final QC.  

7. Key Milestones & Timing (Target: ~8 min total)  
  M1 (0:00–1:00) – Role A fetches station gear; Roles B/C transit to Resource/Build.  
  M2 (1:00–2:30) – Haul complete; mini-station placed; layout marked.  
  M3 (2:30–4:30) – All 20 stairs & 25 concrete processed & staged.  
  M4 (4:30–6:00) – Foundation & iron bars installed.  
  M5 (6:00–7:30) – Stairs placed on three sides (2 builders in parallel).  
  M6 (7:30–8:00) – Final side & QA → Structure completion.  

Communication Checkpoints  
  – “Station up” (M1 end) → role-shift confirmation  
  – “Materials ready” (M3) → kickoff foundation  
  – “Bars in” (M4) → begin stairs  
  – “Stairs done” → final QC & timer stop  

Notes on Speed Optimization  
  • One-trip haul minimizes lookup & travel.  
  • On-site processing eliminates back-and-forth.  
  • Parallel side-by-side stair placement halves that segment’s time.  
  • Pre-mark footprint prevents mid-build measuring.
