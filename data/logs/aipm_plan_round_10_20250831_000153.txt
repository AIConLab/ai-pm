AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 10
Generated at: 20250831_000153
==================================================

RESOURCE COLLECTION  
1. Iron Blocks & Bars (P1)  
 • Trip 1: Go to Resource [34,65,−84]  
 • Collect 7×iron_block (for structure) + 3×iron_block (for ingots)  
 • Collect all 6 orientation‐specific iron_bars  
 • Return to Processing [−69,66,−84], unload in shared chest  

2. Wool & Logs (P2)  
 • Trip 1: Go to Resource  
 • Collect 48×white_wool (for 8 banners)  
 • Collect 3×oak_log (to craft 16 planks → 8 sticks)  
 • Return to Processing, unload  

3. Bars & Buffer (optional P3 or shadow)  
 • If any bars/or blocks left, P3 picks up bars or extra wool on way to Processing  

PROCESSING WORKFLOW (P3 lead, overlap with P1/P2 return)  
1. Craft Iron Ingots  
 • At crafting_table: convert 3 iron_blocks → 27×iron_ingot  
2. Trapdoor Crafting  
 • Craft 6×iron_trapdoor (4 ingots each) → 24 ingots used  
3. Banner Blanks & Dye  
 • At crafting_table: logs → planks → sticks (3 logs → ~16 planks → >8 sticks)  
 • Craft 8 banner_blanks (6 wool + 1 stick each)  
 • Dye each blank with red_dye (from Processing chest) → 8×red_wall_banner  
4. Staging  
 • Place 7 iron_blocks, 6 trapdoors, 6 bars, 8 banners into a single bundle/chest  
 • All three meet up at Chest staging point  

BUILD EXECUTION PLAN (Structure @ [−20,65,−86])  
Divide and conquer by component type and structure quadrant. All start from staging chest at structure.

P1 (Block Layer)  
 • Milestone B1: Place 7 iron_blocks as base/frame  
 • Works continuously from Block 1→7 left→right  

P2 (Bar Layer)  
 • Milestone B2: Install all 6 iron_bars into pre‐set block slots  
 • Place in orientation order:  
   – EB & SB → both ends first  
   – NB & WB → middle crossbars  

P3 (Trapdoors & Banners)  
 • Milestone B3.1: Place 6 iron_trapdoors  
   – 4 east‐facing then north, south  
 • Milestone B3.2: Attach 8 red_wall_banners  
   – 2 each facing N, S, E, W  

CRITICAL PATH & PARALLELISM  
– P1’s block frame must complete before P2/P3 placement begins on each segment.  
– As soon as first 2–3 blocks are down, P2 can start bar placement on those, and P3 can hang trapdoors/banners in cleared sections.  
– Synchronize via voice cue: “Section A ready” → P2+P3 go  

TASK ALLOCATION SUMMARY  
– P1: exclusively gathering iron_blocks/bars then block placement  
– P2: gathering wool/logs + bar placement  
– P3: all processing tasks + trapdoor/banner placement  

KEY MILESTONES  
T0+0s – T0+10s: Resource bundles delivered to Processing  
T0+10s – T0+25s: Trapdoors & banners crafted, items staged at chest  
T0+25s – T0+30s: All at structure location, inventory distributed  
T0+30s – T0+50s: Block frame completed (7 blocks)  
T0+45s – T0+65s: Iron bars placed in parallel  
T0+60s – T0+75s: Trapdoors & banners installed; final check & match  

COMMUNICATION CHECKPOINTS  
– “Blocks down” → P2/P3 begin placements  
– “Bars done” → P3 finish banners/trapdoors  
– “Finish” → Verify pattern/orientations  

This plan minimizes trips (2 each), maximizes parallel build, and front‐loads crafting to eliminate downtime at the structure.
