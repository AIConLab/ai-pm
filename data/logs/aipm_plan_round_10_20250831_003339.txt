AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 10
Generated at: 20250831_003339
==================================================

Strategic Plan for Round 10 – Structure 10  
Team size: 3 players (P1, P2, P3)  
Key distances:  
 • Structure ←→ Resource area ≈ 55 blocks  
 • Structure ←→ Processing area ≈ 50 blocks  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
1. Resource‐Gathering & Inventory Split  
----------------------------------------  
Assign roles before the round start. All three sprint from spawn to the Resource Area ([34.4, 65, –83.75]).  

P1 (“Block‐&‐Bar Runner”)  
 • Grab 7 iron_blocks (for final structure).  
 • Grab 6 iron_bars (any orientation—they’ll place with the correct orientation).  

P2 (“Trapdoor Runner”)  
 • Grab 6 iron_trapdoor.  

P3 (“Banner Runner”)  
 • Grab 8 red_wall_banner.  

Inventory check:  
 • P1 uses 2 slots (blocks stack) + 1 slot (bars stack) = 3 slots.  
 • P2 uses 1 slot.  
 • P3 uses 1 slot.  

Target end of this phase: all three loaded, standing at Resource Area.  
Estimated time: ~12 s

2. Transit to Build Site  
----------------------------------------  
– All three sprint from Resource Area → Structure ([–20.7, 65, –86.1]).  
– No stops.  

Target end of this phase: all three at structure with their loads.  
Estimated time: ~12 s  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
3. Parallel Build Sequence  
----------------------------------------  
Structure composition:  
 • 7 iron blocks (solid shell)  
 • 6 iron trapdoors (2 east, 1 north, 1 south, 2 east)  
 • 6 iron bars (various)  
 • 8 red wall banners (2 per face)  

Assign building sub‐tasks:  

P1 (Blocks & Bars)  
  a. Lay out the 7 iron blocks first, constructing the shell/core.  
  b. Place all 6 iron bars into their exact window locations, orienting each bar as per blueprint.  

P2 (Trapdoors)  
  a. Immediately after P1 places the blocks framing each trapdoor location, P2 snaps in the 6 trapdoors.  
  b. Ensure correct facing by standing on the correct side when placing.  

P3 (Banners)  
  a. As soon as each block–face is complete, P3 attaches 2 banners per face in the required facing direction.  
  b. Work clockwise around the structure—north → east → south → west.  

Build priority (critical path):  
 1. Blocks (foundation & frame)  
 2. Bars (fixed in-frame)  
 3. Trapdoors (snap‐fit into open frames)  
 4. Banners (final decorative touches)

4. Milestones & Timing  
----------------------------------------  
T+0 s  
 • All players sprint to Resource Area.  

T+12 s  
 • P1, P2, P3 loaded with their materials; begin sprint to structure.  

T+24 s  
 • All at build site. Immediately begin placing.  

T+24–50 s (≈26 s build window)  
 • P1 places 7 blocks + 6 bars in parallel with  
   P2 placing 6 trapdoors and  
   P3 placing 8 banners.  

T+50–55 s  
 • Final verification pass: all states/orientations correct.  

T+55 s  
 • Structure complete. Submit.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
5. Communication Checkpoints  
----------------------------------------  
 • “Loaded” once at Resource Area (T+12 s)  
 • “On-site” once at Structure (T+24 s)  
 • “Blocks done” (P1) to signal P2/P3 to start trapdoors/banners  
 • “Bars done” (P1) to confirm no obstructions  
 • “Trapdoors placed” (P2) for P3 to finish banners  
 • “Banners done” (P3) for final sync  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Speed-focus keys:  
 • Zero processing needed – all materials are pre-oriented blocks.  
 • Strict role-split to eliminate overlap.  
 • Parallel build; no idle phases after T+24.  
 • Sprint transportation; immediate placement.  

Anticipated total time: ~55 seconds. Good luck!
