==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
STRATEGY SUMMARY – ROUND 1 (Structure 1)

Team roles (assign once all three players are present):  
• Player 1 (P1) – Oak Stairs  
• Player 2 (P2) – Light Gray Concrete  
• Player 3 (P3) – Iron Bars  

1. RESOURCE COLLECTION  
• P1 (Stairs)  
 – Travel: Structure ← Resource (55 m east) → Processing → Structure  
 – At Resource: take 8 oak logs (32 planks), craft at Processing into planks → craft 20 oak stairs.  
 – Inventory: stairs only (20).  
• P2 (Concrete)  
 – Travel: Structure ← Resource → Processing → Structure  
 – At Resource: collect 25 light_gray_concrete_powder.  
 – At Processing: fill 1 bucket with water.  
 – Inventory: 25 powder + 1 water bucket.  
• P3 (Iron Bars)  
 – Travel: Structure ← Resource → Structure  
 – At Resource: pick 5 “minecraft:iron_bars([east=false,…,west=false])”.  
 – Inventory: 5 iron bars.  

All three begin collection simultaneously.  

2. PROCESSING WORKFLOW  
• Only P1 and P2 use Processing area:  
 – P1: crafting_table → planks → stairs (1 trip).  
 – P2: furnace area bucket → water (instant).  
• No smelting required.  

3. BUILD EXECUTION PLAN  
Milestones (from T=0 when first block placed):  
 M1 – Resources on‐site  
 M2 – Oak stair perimeter complete  
 M3 – Concrete fill complete  
 M4 – Iron bars in position  
 M5 – Final verification & corrections  

Sequence & Parallelism:  
• M1 (t≈ 20 s): all three arrive and stash inventories at build point.  
• M2 (t≈ T+60 s):  
 – P1 places stairs around the 4 sides (5 each, correctly facing).  
• M3 (t≈ T+45 s overlapping):  
 – P2 immediately pours water bucket into one corner, then lays 25 concrete powder blocks against water to instantly convert. Works inward from one edge.  
• M4 (t≈ T+20 s):  
 – P3 places 5 iron bars at their exact blueprint positions (coordination with P1 for no overlap).  
• M5 (t≈ T+15 s):  
 – All players sweep, verify orientations and counts, correct any mis‐placements.

Critical‐path note: P1’s stair crafting + placement is longest single task—start it immediately. P2 and P3 complete faster; they should assist in sweep at end if idle.  

4. TEAM COORDINATION & CHECKPOINTS  
• Call “M1 ready” when all on‐site.  
• P1 calls every 5 stairs placed (“5/20 south done,” etc.).  
• P2 calls when powder run out or fill complete.  
• P3 calls “bars done” immediately upon finish.  
• Final “check” call when M5 validation is complete.  

By parallelizing raw block conversion (P2), simple placement (P3), and more complex crafting + build (P1), you minimize idle time and total round duration. Good luck!

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
Player jc_cr (P1 – Oak Stairs)

1. Travel to Resource area  
   – From current build position, walk 55 blocks east to the oak log grove.  
   – Success: Arrive at the oak trees without dropping below Y 75.

2. Collect raw logs  
   – Chop down oak until you have exactly 8 oak logs in your inventory.  
   – Success: Inventory shows “oak_log x 8.”

3. Process into stairs  
   – Return west to the Processing area (crafting table).  
   – At the crafting table:  
     • Craft 8 oak logs → 32 oak planks.  
     • Craft 32 oak planks → 20 oak stairs.  
   – Success: Inventory shows “oak_stairs x 20” and nothing else (logs/planks cleared).

4. Deliver to Build area & stash  
   – Walk back to the build point.  
   – Place your 20 oak stairs in a single stack on the ground at the build marker.  
   – Call “M1 ready” once all stairs are stashed there.

2. Collect 25 light_gray_concrete_powder.  
3. Move to Processing area; fill an empty bucket with water.  
4. Return to Build area with 25 powder + 1 water bucket.  
Success: Powder and water bucket stashed at build point.

Player 3 (P3 – Iron Bars)  
1. Travel 55 blocks east to Resource.

Next Checkpoint  
• Once jc_cr has “M1 ready” and P2/P3 arrive with their materials, we move immediately into build milestone M2.
