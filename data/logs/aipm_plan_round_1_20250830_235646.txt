==================================================

Strategic Plan – Round 1 / Structure 1

Summary of Requirements  
• Oak stairs – 5 each facing S, E, W, N (20 total)  
• Light-gray concrete – 25 blocks  
• Iron bars – 5 blocks  

Team of 3 (P1, P2, P3) – all start at structure site; unlimited netherite tools/armor.

1. RESOURCE COLLECTION STRATEGY  
– P1 (Oak-Stairs Specialist):  
  • Go to Resource Area once; collect 8 oak logs (→32 planks)  
  • Carry logs back to Processing Area.  
– P2 (Concrete Specialist):  
  • Grab an empty bucket from Processing Area → fill at the water tap.  
  • Go to Resource Area → collect 25 light-gray concrete powder.  
  • Return toward site.  
– P3 (Iron-Bars Specialist):  
  • Single trip to Resource Area → pick up 5 iron bars (the “no-connection” variant).  
  • Return to site with bars.

Inventory per trip:  
P1: 8 logs  
P2: bucket + 25 powder  
P3: 5 bars  

2. PROCESSING WORKFLOW & TIMING  
T0 – T10s:  
  P1 runs logs → Processing Area  
  P2 grabs bucket → fills water  
  P3 en route to Resource Area  

T10 – T25s:  
  P1 crafts logs→32 planks→crafts 5 batches of stairs =20 stairs (plus 12 extra)  
  P2 runs powder + water toward site, pauses near site  
  P3 returns to site with iron bars  

T25 – T30s:  
  P1 picks up oak stairs, heads to build site  
  P2 sets up water-conversion pad at site corner:  
    – Place 2 water source blocks spaced to cover all 8 adjacent spots  
  P3 readies bars for placement

3. BUILD EXECUTION SEQUENCE & PARALLELISM  
Phase A: Foundation & Layout (T30 – T35s)  
  All three stand at site; P1 marks stair positions; P2 marks concrete fill area; P3 marks bar positions.  

Phase B: Install Oak Stairs (T35 – T55s)  
  P1 alone places 20 stairs around perimeter in correct orientation.  
  P2 & P3 stand by with materials to hand off.  

Phase C: Concrete Conversion & Placement (T40 – T60s)  
  P2 takes powder, places powder blocks one row at a time onto water pad → immediate conversion to solid concrete  
  P3 picks up converted blocks and hands them to P1 or places directly in fill spots.  

Phase D: Iron Bars Insertion (T50 – T65s)  
  As soon as stair ring and concrete center are done, P3 walks the perimeter openings and snaps in 5 bars.  

4. TASK ALLOCATION & COMMUNICATION  
• P1 (“Stair Lead”):  
  – Log → planks → stairs processing  
  – Owns stair placement accuracy and speed.  

• P2 (“Concrete Lead”):  
  – Manages bucket + powder → water pad → concrete conversion  
  – Hands off blocks / places directly if idle.  

• P3 (“Bar Lead”):  
  – Fetches bars, stages at site  
  – Finalizes iron-bar placement, assists concrete hand-offs if ahead.  

Call-outs / Checkpoints:  
  – “Stairs ready” @ T25s → P1 signals build start.  
  – “Water pad live” @ T28s → P2 signals concrete begin.  
  – “Bars staged” @ T25s → P3 confirms readiness.  
  – “Mid-build check” @ T50s → ensure stair ring & all 25 concrete in place.  
  – “Final bar sweep” @ T55s → P3 closes out bars.  

Milestones:  
  T0–25s: all raw materials pre-staged + processed  
  T35s: stair ring complete  
  T60s: concrete field filled  
  T65s: bars installed → Structure complete  

Critical Path: oak-stairs crafting ↔ concrete conversion. All other tasks parallelize around these. Success depends on tight 3-task handoffs and real-time status calls. Good luck!
