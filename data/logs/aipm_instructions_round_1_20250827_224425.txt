==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Round 1 Strategic Plan – Structure 1 (Oak Stairs + Light Gray Concrete + Iron Bars)

1. Resource Collection Priorities  
  • Oak Stairs (20 total): craft from Oak Logs  
    – Needs 8 Oak Logs → 32 Planks → 5 crafts ×4 stairs=20  
  • Light Gray Concrete Blocks (25): convert from 25 Light Gray Concrete Powder + Water  
  • Iron Bars (5): direct pickup  

2. Team Roles & Inventory  
  Player 1 (P1): Oak Stairs specialist  
    – Inventory: 8 Oak Logs  
    – Tools: Netherite Pickaxe/Planks/Access to Crafting Table  
  Player 2 (P2): Concrete specialist  
    – Inventory: 25 Concrete Powder, 1 Water Bucket, Silk-Touch Pickaxe  
  Player 3 (P3): Iron Bars + support  
    – Inventory: 5 Iron Bars  

3. Collection & Processing Workflow  
  T0  
    • P1 → Resource area (34.4, –83.8): grab 8 Oak Logs  
    • P2 → Processing area (–69.4, –84.4): pick up Water Bucket & Silk-Touch Pickaxe  
    • P3 → Resource area: grab 5 Iron Bars  
  T0+Δ1  
    • P1 → Processing area: craft Oak Logs→Planks→20 Stairs (use Crafting Table)  
    • P2 → Resource area: collect 25 Powder  
  T0+Δ2  
    • All head to structure (–20.7, –86.1)  

4. Build Execution Sequence  
  Milestone A: Resources delivered at build site  
  Milestone B: Outline complete (stairs + bars)  
  Milestone C: Fill complete (concrete)  

  At structure:  
    Phase 1 (Bars & Stairs Outline – in parallel)  
      • P3: immediately place 5 Iron Bars in correct orientation  
      • P1: place 5 Oak Stairs facing South, then East, North, West (5 each)  
    Phase 2 (Concrete Fill)  
      • P2:  
         – Lay concrete powder in 5×5 interior grid  
         – Use Water Bucket to convert powder→block row by row  
         – Silk-Touch Pick to collect all 25 Light Gray Concrete blocks into inventory  
         – Place converted blocks into the grid  

    Phase 3 (Final Touch)  
      • P3 assists with any misplaced blocks or runs for extra tools if needed  
      • P1 helps concrete placement if ahead  

5. Critical Path & Parallelism  
  • P1’s two-step (Logs→Stairs) and P2’s conversion are longest tasks → start simultaneously  
  • P3’s quick single trip and bar placement runs in parallel and will finish early to support fill  

6. Communication & Checkpoints  
  • “Logs/Stairs Ready” → triggers P1 return  
  • “Powder + Bucket Ready” → triggers P2 return  
  • On arrival: call “Resource Delivered” (Milestone A)  
  • After stairs & bars placed: call “Outline Complete” (Milestone B)  
  • After concrete placed: call “Build Complete” (Milestone C)  

Summary: Each player has a distinct, parallel task that converges at the build site. P1 and P2 start processing immediately on first trip; P3 makes a fast grab-and-place. Handoff via three clear milestones keeps everyone synchronized and ensures fastest overall completion.

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
Player jc_cr:

1. Resource Collection (Milestone “Resources Collected”)  
   • Go to Resource Area at X = 34.4, Z = –83.8 (Y≈68).  
     – Break oak logs until you have exactly 8 Oak Logs in your inventory.  
     – Open the nearby chest and withdraw 5 Iron Bars.  
     – From the same chest, withdraw 25 Light Gray Concrete Powder.  
   • Confirmation: Inventory must show 8 Oak Logs, 5 Iron Bars, 25 Concrete Powder.  
   • In chat, type “Resources Collected” and proceed immediately to Processing Area.

2. Processing & Crafting (Milestone “Resources Processed”)  
   • Travel to Processing Area at X = –69.4, Z = –84.4 (Y≈68).  
   • From the chest by the crafting table, pick up:  
     – 1 Water Bucket  
   • At the crafting table:  
     a. Convert 8 Oak Logs → 32 Oak Planks → craft 5 batches of 4 → 20 Oak Stairs.  
   • On the floor next to the table, lay out all 25 Light Gray Concrete Powder in a 5×5 square.  
   • Use the Water Bucket to pour a line of water across one edge of the grid, converting all powder to solid Light Gray Concrete blocks.  
   • Break and collect all 25 concrete blocks (Diamond Pickaxe is sufficient).  
   • Confirmation: Inventory now holds exactly 20 Oak Stairs, 25 Light Gray Concrete, 5 Iron Bars.  
   • In chat, type “Resources Processed” and head straight to the Build Site.

3. Build Execution  
   Location: Build Site at X = –20.7, Z = –86.1 (Y≈68)

   Phase 1 – Outline (Milestone “Outline Complete”)  
     • Place 5 Iron Bars in their correct slots on the reference frame.  
     • Around the bars, place 20 Oak Stairs:  
       – 5 stairs facing South side  
       – 5 stairs facing East side  
       – 5 stairs facing North side  
       – 5 stairs facing West side  
     • In chat, type “Outline Complete”.

   Phase 2 – Concrete Fill (Milestone “Build Complete”)  
     • Fill the 5×5 interior with your 25 Light Gray Concrete blocks, row by row.

     • In chat, type “Build Complete”.

4. Final Check & Support  
   • Compare your build to the reference. Correct any misplaced blocks.  
   • If you finish early, double-check orientations on stairs and bars.  
   • Once everything matches, the round is done—congratulations!
