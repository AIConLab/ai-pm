==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan – ROUND 1 (Structure 1)

1. Overview  
• Location summary  
 – Build site: (–20.7 / 65 / –86.1)  
 – Resource area: (34.4 / 65 / –83.8)  
 – Processing area: (–69.4 / 66 / –84.4)  
• Required blocks  
 – Oak stairs (20 total: 5 facing each direction)  
 – Light Gray Concrete (25)  
 – Iron Bars (5)  

2. Resource Collection Priorities  
Player 1 (Stairs specialist)  
 • 10–11 oak_logs from resource area  
 • 5 sticks (if needed) from resource area (or pre-crafted)  
Player 2 (Concrete specialist)  
 • 25 light_gray_concrete_powder  
 • 1 empty bucket (from processing area)  
Player 3 (Iron-work specialist)  
 • 5 iron_bars (any correct variant)  

Inventory loads: each item bundle < a single hotbar—no overflow trips.

3. Processing Workflow  
Player 1  
 • Bring logs & sticks straight to build site  
 • Place portable crafting_table at staging just beside build footprint  
 • Craft oak_planks → stairs in two 10-stair batches  
Player 2  
 • At resource area grab powder + bucket  
 • Sprint to processing area → fill bucket from water  
 • At stone slab next to water, dump bucket to create a one-block water source  
 • Lay 25 powder on that block → immediate conversion → recollect 25 concrete blocks  
 • Carry concrete blocks to build site  
Player 3  
 • Iron bars need no processing—direct carry from resource → build site  

4. Build Execution Sequence & Parallelization  
T0–T15 s: All run from spawn → resource area  
T15–T30 s:  
 P1 gathers logs/sticks; P2 powder + bucket; P3 bars  
T30–T45 s:  
 P1 → build site & deploy crafting_table  
 P2 → processing area to convert powder→concrete  
 P3 → build site staging  
T45–T75 s (Stair Ring):  
 P1 crafts and installs all 20 stairs in perimeter order: South→West→North→East  
 P3 pre-marks iron-bar mounting holes on floor  
T75–T100 s (Concrete Infill):  
 P2 arrives with 25 concrete blocks  
 P2 + P3 together fill interior grid in row-by-row strokes  
T100–T115 s (Iron Bars):  
 P3 (with P1 backup) snaps 5 iron bars into pre-marked positions  
T115 s: Final check & adjust; structure complete  

5. Task Allocation & Checkpoints  
Player 1 (Wood/Stairs):  
 – T0–30: log pickup & site prep  
 – T30–75: craft+place stairs  
 – T100–115: QA & backup bar install  
Player 2 (Concrete):  
 – T0–30: powder+bucket  
 – T30–75: convert powder→concrete  
 – T75–100: deliver and place concrete  
Player 3 (Iron Bars & Support):  
 – T0–30: bars pickup  
 – T45–75: lay out bar positions  
 – T75–115: assist concrete placement & install bars  

6. Milestones & Communication  
M1 (T30 s): “Materials at staging”—all players confirm pickups  
M2 (T75 s): “Stair ring up”—P1 signals ready  
M3 (T100 s): “Concrete done”—P2 confirms fill complete  
M4 (T115 s): “Bars in place”—P3 calls “Structure done”  

Focus on sprinting between nodes, minimal inventory juggling, strict adherence to the timeline, and callouts at each milestone to ensure no idle time. This pipeline maximizes parallel work and drives total build time under 2 minutes.

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr:

You’re soloing all three roles—follow these timed, milestone-driven steps exactly. Keep sprint toggled on, minimal inventory juggling. Call out each milestone when you hit it.

T0–T15 s: Run → Resource Area  
• Walk/sprint from X:-30.0/Y:69.5/Z:-74.7 to (34.4/65/–83.8).  
Arrive by 15 s.

T15–T35 s: Gather Raw Materials (M1 “Materials at staging”)  
At Resource Area (34.4/65/–83.8):  
 • Break and pick up 11 oak_logs.  
 • Break or open crates for 25 light_gray_concrete_powder.  
 • Break or loot 5 iron_bars.  
Inventory check:  
 oak_logs ≥11, concrete_powder ≥25, iron_bars ≥5.  
Call out “M1 complete” at 35 s.

T35–T50 s: Sprint → Processing Area & Convert (M2 “Concrete ready”)  
1. Run to Processing Area at (–69.4/66/–84.4) by 40 s.  
2. Open nearby chest, grab 1 empty bucket.  
3. Walk to water trough by stone slab: fill bucket → water_bucket.  
4. Place water_bucket on slab to make a one-block water source → recover empty bucket.  
5. On top of that block, dump 25 concrete_powder → it hardens to 25 light_gray_concrete.  
6. Pick up all 25 concrete blocks.  
Inventory now: oak_logs ≥11, concrete_blocks 25, iron_bars 5, bucket.  
Call out “M2 complete” at 50 s.

T50–T55 s: Sprint → Build Site  
Run to build site at (–20.7/65/–86.1). Arrive by 55 s.

T55–T60 s: Site Prep  
1. At staging point 2 blocks north of footprint, place 11 oak_logs.  
2. Place your personal crafting_table beside logs.  
3. Using crafting_table:  
   • Craft 32 oak_planks from logs.  
   • From planks, reserve 10 sticks (2 planks → 4 sticks).  
   • Craft 20 oak_stairs in two batches of 10.

T60–T80 s: Build Stair Ring (M3 “Stair ring up”)  
Trace a 5×5 square ring around the footprint, placing all 20 stairs facing outward in this order:  
 1. South side (5 stairs facing South)  
 2. West side (5 facing West)  
 3. North side (5 facing North)  
 4. East side (5 facing East)  
Call out “M3 complete” at 80 s.

T80–T95 s: Concrete Infill (M4 “Concrete done”)  
1. Fill the 3×3 interior grid with your 25 light_gray_concrete blocks.  
2. Place row-by-row, starting at the southwest interior corner, moving east, then next row north.  
Call out “M4 complete” at 95 s.

T95–T110 s: Iron Bars Installation (M5 “Bars in place”)  
1. Pre-mark the 5 bar positions in the ring (one per side, centered).  
2. Snap in 5 iron_bars into those slots.  
Call out “M5 complete” at 110 s.

T110–T115 s: Final QA & Wrap  
• Walk entire perimeter, check orientation & fill.  
• Adjust any misplaced block.  
At 115 s call out “Structure done.”  

You’re aiming to finish under 2 minutes. Keep inventory neat—always carry only what you need for the next step. Good luck!
