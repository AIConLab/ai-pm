AIPM Player Instructions - Round 4

==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Summary (fast): split work into 3 roles — Runner A (iron supply + staging), Runner B (concrete powder + torches), Processor/Distributor (convert iron_blocks → ingots, craft iron door) — Builder stays at the structure and places blocks as they arrive. Key bottleneck = converting iron_blocks to ingots and crafting 27 trapdoors; use inventory crafting to parallelize trapdoor production once ingots are available. Route planning: resource -> structure -> processing to avoid extra back-and-forth.

1) Resource collection priorities
- Immediate collection (no processing required / stage at structure or processing):
  - Iron_block x25 total (see reasoning below): collect all from resource area in one trip if possible (25 < 64 stack).
    - 12 iron_blocks are final placed blocks — stage these directly at the structure.
    - 13 iron_blocks are sacrificial to convert into ingots for trapdoors + door — bring these to processing.
  - Orange_concrete_powder x19 — must be converted to orange_concrete (see processing). Bring these to the processing area in one load.
  - Redstone_torch x4 — take from resource chests and stage at structure (or give to builder).
- Why 25 iron_blocks: trapdoors and an iron door require iron ingots. Rough calculation: 27 trapdoors + 1 door need ~110 iron ingots; 1 iron_block → 9 ingots → need 13 iron_blocks for ingots. Add the 12 iron_blocks to place = 25 total.
- Inventory management:
  - One runner can carry all 25 iron_blocks and 19 powder in two stacks (25 and 19) — but avoid mixing staging. Use two runners to avoid single-point delay:
    - Runner A: all iron_blocks (25). On the way back from resource, drop 12 at structure, continue to processing with 13.
    - Runner B: orange_concrete_powder x19 + redstone_torches x4 + any redstone (if needed) → processing.
  - Keep slot reservations:
    - Each runner keeps 1 hotbar slot free for the water bucket (processing) and 1 slot for redstone torches to avoid clutter.
    - Distribute ingots/trapdoors into 1–2 hotbar stacks for the builder for quick placement.

2) Processing workflow (order & timing)
- What must be processed:
  - Iron_block → 9 iron_ingots (crafting table; requires 3x3).
  - Iron_ingots → iron_trapdoor (inventory 2x2 or 3x3 craft), and iron_door (requires crafting table).
  - Orange_concrete_powder → orange_concrete (use water bucket on powder, then break/collect concrete).
- Processing order & parallelization:
  1. When Runner A delivers 13 iron_blocks to processing, Processor converts all 13 → 117 ingots using the crafting table (batch crafting; quick).
  2. Processor crafts the 1 iron_door using the crafting table (only one uses the table).
  3. Processor divides the ingots into stacks and hands them to players (or drops stacks in chest/ground) for trapdoor crafting. Iron trapdoors can be crafted in the player's 2x2 inventory grid — so multiple players craft trapdoors in parallel (big speedup).
  4. While ingots are being split, Runner B uses the water bucket + processing water to convert orange powder → concrete. Convert in a 1×19 line or a small pad and break to collect. Refill bucket as needed (processing area has water and bucket).
- Player assignment at processing:
  - Processor (role): stay at processing until ingots are converted and iron door crafted — splitting/delivering ingots to teammates.
  - Runner B can assist converting powder to concrete while Processor handles iron conversions.
  - As soon as players have ingots, they should begin crafting trapdoors into hotbar stacks and immediately shuttle them to the builder.

3) Build execution plan (fastest sequence & parallel work)
- Construction sequencing:
  1. Stage 12 iron_blocks at the structure immediately (Runner A drops them). Builder starts placing iron_block structural pieces right away — this is useful because these blocks are both required and do not depend on processing.
  2. While iron block shell is being placed, Runner B and Processor convert powder → concrete and craft the iron door. Builder receives and places orange concrete as it arrives; do orange surfaces after core iron_block skeleton to avoid obstruction.
  3. Trapdoors (27) should be crafted in parallel by the two non-builder players and delivered in batches to the builder for rapid placement; the builder installs trapdoors once the iron-block framework is present in the area they go.
  4. Redstone torches (4) placed last where the blueprint requires (they’re immediate items).
- Parallel opportunities:
  - Player at structure (Builder) places iron_blocks and begins placing orange concrete in regions that are already filled or accessible.
  - Two other players (Processor + Runner B) work at processing to convert ingots/powder, craft trapdoors in parallel, and ferry completed items to builder.
  - While one player ferries a batch to the builder, the other continues crafting trapdoors/pouring concrete.
- Critical path:
  - Conversion of 13 iron_blocks → ingots and crafting 27 trapdoors is the bottleneck. Parallel crafting of trapdoors by multiple players after ingots are available is essential to minimize time.
  - Concrete conversion is fast and can be overlapped with ingot conversion.

4) Team coordination, tasks & milestones
- Role allocation (3-player):
  - Player 1 (Runner A / Iron Stager): run to resource area, pick up 25 iron_blocks. Route: resource → structure (drop 12) → processing (deliver 13). After delivering, come back to structure to help place iron_blocks and craft trapdoors if needed.
  - Player 2 (Runner B / Concrete & Torches): pick up orange_concrete_powder x19 and redstone_torches x4 from resource → processing. Convert powder → concrete (use water bucket). Help deliver concrete and torches to structure. Also help craft trapdoors from distributed ingots.
  - Player 3 (Processor / Builder): start at structure as the builder (if starting position near structure). If starting elsewhere, go to processing first to be ready when iron_blocks arrive. Processor converts iron_blocks → ingots using crafting_table, crafts iron door, splits ingots and hands them off. Builder places blocks, installs trapdoors/door/torches as they arrive.
- Communication checkpoints (short, specific):
  - "Iron collected" — Runner A after departing resource with 25 iron_blocks.
  - "12 iron staged" — Runner A after staging at structure (builder can start).
  - "13 iron at processing" — Processor converts immediately.
  - "Ingots ready / handing out" — Processor to others (start crafting trapdoors).
  - "Concrete ready xN" — Runner B to builder on delivery.
  - "Trapdoors delivered batch n" — players sending counts so builder can plan placements.
  - "Finish check" — Builder signals when last placements are done; teammates do quick inventory check then final clean/align.
- Milestones with targets (time-box each if you use a clock):
  1. T+0–0:30s — Both runners arrive back at structure/processing with first stage (12 iron staged; powder & torches at processing).
  2. T+0:30–1:00 — Processor finishes converting 13 iron_blocks → ingots and crafts iron door; begins distributing ingots.
  3. T+1:00–1:40 — All players craft trapdoors in parallel and first batch is delivered; builder has completed skeleton iron-block placements and begins trapdoor placement.
  4. T+1:40–2:30 — Orange concrete converted and delivered; builder finishes concrete placements and door/trapdoor placements.
  5. Final T+2:30–3:00 — Place redstone torches, final orientation/power states, quick full-check vs blueprint and finish.
  (Adjust times to your team speed — these are targets for coordination; the critical path is ingot→trapdoor crafting.)

5) Quick contingency / solo fallback (current state: only jc_cr active)
If only one player (jc_cr) is available, do this streamlined route:
- Single-player route: resource → structure → processing → structure loop.
  1. Run to resource, get 25 iron_blocks + 19 orange_powder + redstone_torches. (All in one trip if inventory fits; if not, do two controlled trips.)
  2. On return, drop 12 iron_blocks at structure to start immediate placements.
  3. Go to processing, convert 13 iron_blocks → ingots, craft iron door at crafting table.
  4. Convert orange powder → concrete at processing water.
  5. Craft trapdoors in inventory (this is serial and the main time sink) and place them as you move between processing and structure — try to craft a batch, run to structure, place them, return. Optimize by crafting as many trapdoors as you can carry before each trip to reduce travel.
  6. Final placements and checks.
- Solo tip: prioritize staging and immediate placement of the 12 iron_blocks and convert concrete early. Expect trapdoor crafting to dominate solo time.

6) Short checklist before go signal
- Confirm two runners know route order: resource → structure (drop) → processing (deliver remaining).
- Reserve hotbar slots: water bucket, hotbar stacks for trapdoors, building block, and a stack for door items/torches.
- Processor confirms crafting_table access and bucket placement at water.
- Builder is ready at structure with schematic area cleared and knows the order of block placement for the blueprint.

Resulting priorities (one-line):
- Single most important: get 13 iron_blocks to processing immediately so ingots and trapdoors can be produced in parallel.
- Second: stage 12 iron_blocks at structure so builder can start instantly.
- Third: convert orange powder early and deliver concrete while trapdoors are being made.

If you want, I can convert this plan into an exact step-by-step timed sprint for your three specific players (with who moves when at 10–15 second granularity) — tell me your team average walk/run and craft speed and I’ll produce a minute-by-minute script.

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr: Start the solo sprint now. Run to the resource area and collect these exact items before returning: 25 iron_blocks, 19 orange_concrete_powder, and 4 redstone_torches. Also take a water bucket if available (or an empty bucket to fill at processing). Reserve one hotbar slot for the water bucket and one hotbar slot for immediate trapdoor stacks/placement; keep a building block/tool in another hotbar slot so you never need to open inventory while placing. Route: resource → structure → processing → structure loops. On the way back from resource, stop at the structure and drop/stage exactly 12 iron_blocks at the build area so you can begin placing immediately; signal "12 staged" by chat. Continue immediately to the processing area with the remaining 13 iron_blocks. At processing: convert all 13 iron_blocks into iron_ingots (target: 117 ingots total) using the crafting table; craft 1 iron_door from those ingots at the crafting table. After crafting, split/store the ingots into accessible stacks: put a full stack in the processing chest or on the ground and keep the remainder in your inventory so you can craft trapdoors without extra trips. While ingots are splitting, convert the 19 orange_concrete_powder into 19 orange_concrete by pouring water with the bucket over the powder line and breaking/collecting the concrete; refill the bucket as needed. Success criteria at processing: 13 iron_blocks converted → 117 ingots, iron_door crafted, 19 powder → 19 concrete collected. Begin crafting trapdoors in your inventory using the ingots: craft the 27 trapdoors as quickly as possible in batches you can carry (craft as many as your hotbar/inventory lets you per trip). Deliver trapdoors and concrete to the structure in batches: when you have a stack of trapdoors, run to structure, place them in the open spots on the iron_block skeleton (you already staged 12 blocks) and place the iron_door where the blueprint requires. After concrete delivery, place orange concrete pieces in accessible areas of the build while keeping the iron-block core clear for trapdoor installation. Finally place the 4 redstone_torches in their blueprint locations. End-state success criteria: 12 iron_blocks staged at structure and skeleton placed; 13 iron_blocks processed into 117 ingots and 1 door crafted; 27 trapdoors crafted and placed; 19 orange_concrete placed; 4 redstone_torches placed; final visual check vs blueprint completed. If inventory limits force extra trips, prioritize: always stage 12 iron_blocks first, then get 13 blocks to processing, then concrete conversion, then batch craft trapdoors and shuttle them to the build. Keep chat updates: "Iron collected" when leaving resource, "12 staged" when iron dropped at structure, "13 at processing" on arrival, "Ingots ready" when ingots/door are done, "Concrete ready xN" when powder converted, and "Trapdoors delivered batch n" after each delivery so you can track progress.
