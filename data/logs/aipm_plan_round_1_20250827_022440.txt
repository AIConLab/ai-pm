==================================================

Strategic Plan – Round 1 (Structure 1)

Team roles (P1–P3) assume all spawn at structure site at T₀.  

1. Resource & Tool Staging  
  • P1 → Processing area (−69 X)  
      – Grab 1× crafting_table, 1× water_bucket, 1× scaffolding stack  
      – Run straight to build site, drop crafting_table & bucket in staging zone.  
  • P2 → Resource area (+34 X)  
      – In one sweep collect:  
        · 8 oak_logs (for 32 planks → 20 stairs)  
        · 1 stack light_gray_concrete_powder (need 25)  
        · 5 iron_bars ([all false])  
      – Return direct to build site.  
  • P3 → Resource area (same trip window as P2)  
      – Optional “runner” to back up P2 if mis-stack or snag. Otherwise proceed to site empty-handed as third builder.  

   ­— Travel times:  
     P1 Processing→Site ~45 s  
     P2/3 Resource→Site ~55 s  

2. On-Site Processing & Prep (T≈55–80 s)  
  • P1 sets up crafting_table & places water bucket on staging slab.  
  • P2 dumps all powder & iron_bars into staging chest or floor-stack.  
  • P1 crafts stairs on table:  
      – Logs→planks via 2×2 grid (8 logs→32 planks instant)  
      – 5× stair recipes (6 planks→4 stairs) = 20 stairs total (~5 s per craft ×5 =25 s)  
      – Hands stair stacks to P2 or P3 as crafted.  
  • P2 converts concrete powder → block:  
      – Lay powder in 5×5 pad, use water_bucket → concrete blocks, break into inventory (~20 s).  

3. Build Execution & Parallel Placement (T≈80 s onward)  
  • P3 (Lead Builder) reads blueprint and lays out footprint with temporary block markers or ground-level guidelines.  
  • P2 & P1 feed P3:  
      – P1 hands over stairs as needed.  
      – P2 hands over concrete blocks and iron bars.  
  • All three place blocks in lock-step:  
      – P3 focuses on orientation-critical pieces (stairs & iron_bars).  
      – P1/P2 fill light_gray_concrete.  
      – Use scaffolding for any overhead placement.  

4. Critical Path & Milestones  
  Milestone 1 (T≈55 s) – All raw materials & kit staged at site.  
  Milestone 2 (T≈80 s) – All stairs crafted & concrete blocks ready.  
  Milestone 3 (T≈85 s) – First block placed; continuous pipeline begins.  
  Milestone 4 (T≈120 s) – 50 % of blocks placed (checked against blueprint).  
  Milestone 5 (T≈150 s) – All orientation-sensitive elements (25 stairs, 5 iron_bars) placed.  
  Final check & touch-ups (T≈160 s target).  

5. Communication Checkpoints  
  • “Resources staged” @ 55 s  
  • “Processing done” @ 80 s  
  • “50 % built” @ 120 s  
  • “Stairs/Iron done” @ 150 s  

Summary of Optimizations  
  – One‐trip harvest of all raw materials (P2)  
  – One‐trip tool deployment and on-site processing (P1)  
  – Dedicated builder (P3) w/ two feeders to sustain maximum place-rate  
  – Milestone‐based pacing to avoid idle time and bottle-necks.
