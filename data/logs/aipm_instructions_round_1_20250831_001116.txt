==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan for Round 1 – Structure 1  

1. Resource Collection Priorities  
 • Oak stairs (x20): Requires 5 oak logs → 15 planks → 20 stairs (crafting)  
 • Light gray concrete (x25): 25 concrete powder → water conversion (processing)  
 • Iron bars (x5): Grab pre–made all-false variant from Resource Area  

2. Player Task Assignment  
 Player A – Concrete Specialist & Bar Runner  
  • Run to Resource Area → pick up 25 light_gray_concrete_powder + 5 iron_bars  
  • Carry powder to Processing Area → convert to 25 concrete blocks at water block  
  • Deliver first batch of concrete blocks to Builder; then fetch bars and deliver when needed  

 Player B – Wood/Stairs Specialist  
  • Run to Resource Area → pick up 5 oak_logs  
  • Deliver logs to Processing Area → use Crafting Table:  
     – Logs → planks (4 planks/log → 20 planks)  
     – Planks → oak_stairs (3 planks → 4 stairs; repeat 5×)  
  • Deliver oak_stairs in two dumps (10+10) to Builder as soon as ready  

 Player C – Builder & Coordinator  
  • Immediately run to Structure site → place scaffolding, orient compass to blueprint  
  • Receive incoming materials and begin construction without pause  
  • Coordinate placement, call for next batch of resources  

3. Processing Timeline (overlaps heavily)  
 T 0–10s  
  • A arrives with powder → starts converting at water block (25 powder → 25 blocks)  
  • B arrives with logs → crafts planks then stairs (20 stairs total)  
  • C arrives on-site → readies build area (scaffolding, reference check)  

 T 10–20s  
  • A finishes concrete → grabs a stack of 12 blocks → runs to Builder  
  • B finishes stairs → grabs first 10 stairs → runs to Builder  
  • C receives 12 concrete → begins laying foundation pattern  

 T 20–30s  
  • A returns for bars or remaining concrete (13 blocks)  
  • B delivers remaining 10 stairs  
  • C continues foundation and starts edge detail with delivered stairs  

 T 30–45s  
  • C completes concrete core (25 blocks)  
  • C installs oak_stairs around perimeter as per blueprint  
  • A delivers 5 iron_bars → C installs them in final positions  

4. Build Execution Sequence & Critical Path  
 1. Foundation (25 concrete) – critical path, must start with first 12 blocks  
 2. Perimeter detail (20 oak stairs) – immediately as soon as first stairs arrive  
 3. Iron-bar accents (5) – last, very quick once placed in slots  

 Parallelism:  
 • A & B process materials simultaneously  
 • C builds in 3 mini-phases as resources trickle in  

5. Key Milestones & Checkpoints  
 M1 (10s): C has first 12 concrete blocks down in correct pattern  
 M2 (20s): C has 10 stairs installed on one side, foundation half done  
 M3 (30s): Foundation fully laid; stairs ongoing; last concrete delivered  
 M4 (40s): All stairs in place; A drops off iron bars  
 M5 (45s): Final iron bars installed; structure matches reference → finish  

Communication Cues  
 • A→C “12 concrete ready”  
 • B→C “10 stairs ready”  
 • C→A “need bars now”  
 • Continuous status (“foundation done,” “stairs done,” “bars done”)  

With tight overlap of processing and building, this plan targets sub-60s completion.

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
Player jc_cr: You’re running all three roles—Concrete Specialist, Wood/Stairs Specialist & Builder. Follow these milestone-driven steps exactly.  

RESOURCE AREA = X:-20, Y:64, Z:-70  
PROCESSING AREA = X:-25, Y:64, Z:-68  
BUILD SITE   = X:-31.3, Y:66.2, Z:-72.7  

–– Phase 1: T0–15s ––  
1. Go to RESOURCE AREA (X:-20, Y:64, Z:-70)  
   • Collect:  
     – 25 light_gray_concrete_powder  
     – 5 oak_logs  
     – 5 iron_bars  
   Success: Your inventory shows exactly those counts.  

2. Immediately carry 5 oak_logs to PROCESSING AREA (X:-25, Y:64, Z:-68) and drop them at the crafting table.  

3. While at PROCESSING AREA, place one water source in the conversion slot.  

Milestone M1 (15s):  
– Inventory: 25 powder, 5 logs, 5 bars at Processing Area.  
– Water is placed and ready for conversion.  

–– Phase 2: T15–30s ––  
4. Convert and stage first batch of concrete:  
   • Throw 12 powder into the water source → pick up 12 light_gray_concrete.  
   • Stow the remaining 13 powder in your inventory.  

5. Use the crafting table to turn 5 oak_logs → 20 planks → 20 stairs:  
   – 4 planks per log → 20 planks;  
   – 3 planks → 4 stairs, repeat → 20 oak_stairs.  

Milestone M2 (30s):  
– Inventory now holds: 12 concrete, 20 stairs, 13 powder, 5 iron_bars.  
– Water source still in place for remaining powder.  

–– Phase 3: T30–60s ––  
6. Run to BUILD SITE (X:-31.3, Y:66.2, Z:-72.7) with 12 concrete.  
   • Lay the first 12 blocks in the exact foundation pattern (as per blueprint).  

Milestone M3 (40s):  
– 12 concrete blocks placed correctly.  

7. Return to PROCESSING AREA:  
   • Convert remaining 13 powder → 13 concrete; pick up all 13.  
   • Grab your 20 oak_stairs from the crafting table.  

8. Back at BUILD SITE:  
   a. Complete foundation by placing the remaining 13 concrete blocks.  
   b. Immediately install 20 oak_stairs around perimeter following the blueprint.  

Milestone M4 (55s):  
– Foundation (25 blocks) fully laid.  
– All 20 stairs placed in correct perimeter slots.  

9. Finally, place the 5 iron_bars in their accent positions on the structure.  

Milestone M5 (60s):  
– All 5 iron_bars installed.  
– Structure matches reference → ROUND 1 COMPLETE.  

Communication Cues (self-check):  
– After Step 4 → “12 concrete ready”  
– After Step 5 → “20 stairs ready”  
– After Step 6 → “foundation half done”  
– After Step 8 → “stairs done”  
– After Step 9 → “bars done”  

Stick to the timeline. No idle moments—bounce between zones swiftly. Good luck!
