==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan for Round 10 – 3-Player Team

1. Summary of Requirements  
 • Iron blocks: 7 for build + 2 to convert → total 9 blocks  
 • Iron trapdoors: 6 (craft from ingots)  
 • Iron bars: 6 individually oriented pieces (all available pre-crafted)  
 • Red wall banners: 8 (craft from wool + sticks + red dye)  

Build site is at [-20.7, 65.0, -86.1]. Resource area at [34.4, 65.0, -83.8]. Processing area (for dye & crafting table) at [-69.4, 66.0, -84.4].

2. Resource Collection Plan  
• Player A (“Iron Runner”)  
  – From spawn to Resource area: collect  
    · 9 × iron_block  
    · 6 × iron_bars (take the six exact orientations)  
  – Return direct to Build site, deposit in a temporary chest (or on-ground pile).  
• Player B (“Wool & Wood”)  
  – To Resource area: collect  
    · 48 × white_wool  
    · 1 × oak_log (for plank→sticks)  
  – En route to Build site, at a safe midway spot craft:  
    · Planks → sticks (4 planks → 8 sticks)  
  – Deliver wool + sticks to the Build site.  
• Player C (“Dye & Table”)  
  – Direct to Processing area: grab  
    · ≥8 × red_dye (from chest)  
    · 1 × crafting_table  
  – Proceed direct to Build site.  

3. Processing & Crafting Workflow (at Build site)  
All crafting is done on-site to eliminate extra travel. Upon arrival:  
• Player A (or B) places the crafting_table in a corner of the build footprint.  
• Craft and distribute:  
  – 2 iron_blocks → 18 iron_ingots  
  – 18 iron_ingots → 6 iron_trapdoors (craft in 3×2 grid)  
  – 48 wool + 8 sticks → 8 red_banners → orient on wall as red_wall_banner  
• Distribute trapdoors and banners to the placer.  

4. Build Execution & Task Allocation  
Phase 1 – Foundation & Frame (parallel)  
• Player A: Begin placing the 7 iron_blocks in blueprint positions.  
• Player B: Lay out the 6 iron_bars in correct orientation spots.  
   (Both work clockwise from one corner to avoid overlap.)  

Phase 2 – Detail Installation (once Phase 1 has at least two-thirds complete)  
• Player C:  
   1) Craft trapdoors & banners (5–10 s)  
   2) Hand off to Player B for banner placement and Player A for trapdoors.  
• Player A: Install 6 iron_trapdoors into their exact facings.  
• Player B: Mount 8 red_wall_banners into their specified facings.  

Phase 3 – Final QA & Touch-ups  
• All three sweep remaining blocks for mis-placements.  
• Correct any orientation errors (bars/trapdoors/banners).  

5. Critical-Path & Milestones  
Milestone 1 (t + 0:00–0:30)  
 • All three depart spawn, resource gathering in parallel.  
Milestone 2 (t + 0:30–1:00)  
 • P A & P B arrive at resource area; P C at processing area.  
Milestone 3 (t + 1:00–1:30)  
 • All three en route or arriving at build site; resources staged.  
Milestone 4 (t + 1:30–2:30)  
 • Phase 1 complete: iron_blocks + iron_bars fully placed.  
Milestone 5 (t + 2:30–3:00)  
 • Trapdoors & banners crafted and placed.  
Milestone 6 (t + 3:00–3:15)  
 • QA pass, finish.  

6. Communication & Checkpoints  
 • “Resource clear” call when each player finishes gathering.  
 • “Resources down” when all materials are at build site.  
 • “Frame 2/3” when 2/3 of blocks and bars are up—cue detail crafting.  
 • “Final check” when trapdoors/banners installed.  

By pipelining all crafting at the build site, splitting the three gather tasks, and parallelizing foundation vs. detailing, this plan minimizes dead time and travel and hits a tight 3 minute target.
