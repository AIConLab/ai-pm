AIPM Player Instructions - Round 10
Generated at: 20250831_001026
==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Resource Collection (one synchronized round‐trip to the resource area)  
  • Player 1 → iron_block ×9  
  • Player 2 → iron_bars ×6  
  • Player 3 → iron_trapdoor ×6 & red_wall_banner ×8  
    – (If trapdoors/banners are not pre-crafted: Player 3 grabs 2 extra iron_blocks + stick/dye materials, hauls them to the Processing Area, crafts 6 trapdoors and 8 banners on a single furnace/crafting-table cycle, then heads to the Structure.)  
  • Departure window: all three leave spawn ≤5 s apart → gather in ≤15 s total  

Processing Workflow  
  • Ideally none (all items pre-crafted).  
  • Fallback (if raw materials only):  
    – P3 hauls 2 iron_blocks → Processing Area (≈20 s travel), crafts 18 iron_ingots in blast furnace (30 s), crafts 6 trapdoors (1×crafting table), dyes/wool → 8 banners in parallel.  
    – Total P3 processing time ≈60 s. Meanwhile P1&P2 head straight to the Structure with their loads.  

Build Execution Sequence (at Structure)  
  1. Foundation & shell (P1)  
     • Lay out 7 iron_blocks in the exact footprint; build up walls to required height.  
     • Target time: 30 s  
  2. Iron bars installation (P2)  
     • Pre-stage bars on ground perimeter, then place in designated block holes/orientations.  
     • Can begin as soon as the first ring of blocks is in place.  
     • Target time: 20 s  
  3. Banners & trapdoors (P3)  
     • As soon as adjacent block faces are available, affix wall banners in correct facing order (N×2, W×2, E×2, S×2), then snap in trapdoors (E×4, N×1, S×1).  
     • Target time: 20 s  

Critical Path & Parallelism  
  • P1’s block frame unlocks P2’s bars  
  • P2’s bars unlock P3’s banners/trapdoors  
  • Total build overlap: ~70 s  

Player Task Allocation  
  • P1 (Frame Specialist): iron_blocks → Structure → build shell  
  • P2 (Bar Specialist): iron_bars → Structure → install bars as soon as blocks permit  
  • P3 (Detail Specialist): trapdoors & banners → Structure → place decorative/functional elements  

Communication Checkpoints & Milestones  
  T+0 s: Depart spawn  
  T+15 s: All items in inventory; depart resource (or P3 departs Processing if needed)  
  T+45 s: P1&P2 arrive Structure; P1 begins foundation, P2 stages bars  
  T+75 s: Foundation complete → P2 places bars, P3 arrives with details  
  T+95 s: Bars complete → P3 places banners/trapdoors  
  T+115 s: Final check vs. blueprint → submit  

By funneling all resource collection into a single synchronized trip, pipelining any minor processing solely on Player 3, and overlapping build phases as soon as dependencies clear, total round time is minimized.

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr (all‐roles):

Phase 1 – Resource Collection (T 0–15 s)  
• Depart spawn immediately, arrive at Resource Area by T+10 s.  
• At Resource Area:  
  - Break and collect 9 iron_block  
  - Break and collect 6 iron_bars  
  - Break and collect 6 iron_trapdoor  
  - Break and collect 8 red_wall_banner  
• Success criteria by T+15 s in inventory:  
  – 9 iron_block, 6 iron_bars, 6 iron_trapdoor, 8 red_wall_banner  
• If trapdoors or banners aren’t available: also collect  
  – +2 iron_block, +2 sticks, +10 red wool (or red dye+wool)

Phase 2 – Processing (only if raw mats collected) (T 15–75 s)  
• Haul raw to Processing Area (blast furnace + crafting table)  
• At blast furnace: smelt 2 iron_block → 18 iron_ingot (≈30 s)  
• At crafting table (parallel):  
  - Craft 6 iron_trapdoor (2 ingots + 1 stick each)  
  - Craft 8 red_wall_banner (6 wool + 1 stick each)  
• Success criteria by T+75 s in inventory:  
  – 6 iron_trapdoor, 8 red_wall_banner plus your 9 iron_block & 6 iron_bars

Phase 3 – Transit to Build Area (T 75–90 s)  
• Load all 4 item types and head straight to Structure 10  
• Arrive by T+90 s ready for shell build (P1), bar install (P2) and detail placement (P3)  

Tank‐check at each handoff: see that you’re carrying the exact counts before you leave each area.  
Good luck—on to the build!
