==================================================

Strategic Plan – ROUND 1 (Structure 1)

1. Overview  
• Location summary  
 – Build site: (–20.7 / 65 / –86.1)  
 – Resource area: (34.4 / 65 / –83.8)  
 – Processing area: (–69.4 / 66 / –84.4)  
• Required blocks  
 – Oak stairs (20 total: 5 facing each direction)  
 – Light Gray Concrete (25)  
 – Iron Bars (5)  

2. Resource Collection Priorities  
Player 1 (Stairs specialist)  
 • 10–11 oak_logs from resource area  
 • 5 sticks (if needed) from resource area (or pre-crafted)  
Player 2 (Concrete specialist)  
 • 25 light_gray_concrete_powder  
 • 1 empty bucket (from processing area)  
Player 3 (Iron-work specialist)  
 • 5 iron_bars (any correct variant)  

Inventory loads: each item bundle < a single hotbar—no overflow trips.

3. Processing Workflow  
Player 1  
 • Bring logs & sticks straight to build site  
 • Place portable crafting_table at staging just beside build footprint  
 • Craft oak_planks → stairs in two 10-stair batches  
Player 2  
 • At resource area grab powder + bucket  
 • Sprint to processing area → fill bucket from water  
 • At stone slab next to water, dump bucket to create a one-block water source  
 • Lay 25 powder on that block → immediate conversion → recollect 25 concrete blocks  
 • Carry concrete blocks to build site  
Player 3  
 • Iron bars need no processing—direct carry from resource → build site  

4. Build Execution Sequence & Parallelization  
T0–T15 s: All run from spawn → resource area  
T15–T30 s:  
 P1 gathers logs/sticks; P2 powder + bucket; P3 bars  
T30–T45 s:  
 P1 → build site & deploy crafting_table  
 P2 → processing area to convert powder→concrete  
 P3 → build site staging  
T45–T75 s (Stair Ring):  
 P1 crafts and installs all 20 stairs in perimeter order: South→West→North→East  
 P3 pre-marks iron-bar mounting holes on floor  
T75–T100 s (Concrete Infill):  
 P2 arrives with 25 concrete blocks  
 P2 + P3 together fill interior grid in row-by-row strokes  
T100–T115 s (Iron Bars):  
 P3 (with P1 backup) snaps 5 iron bars into pre-marked positions  
T115 s: Final check & adjust; structure complete  

5. Task Allocation & Checkpoints  
Player 1 (Wood/Stairs):  
 – T0–30: log pickup & site prep  
 – T30–75: craft+place stairs  
 – T100–115: QA & backup bar install  
Player 2 (Concrete):  
 – T0–30: powder+bucket  
 – T30–75: convert powder→concrete  
 – T75–100: deliver and place concrete  
Player 3 (Iron Bars & Support):  
 – T0–30: bars pickup  
 – T45–75: lay out bar positions  
 – T75–115: assist concrete placement & install bars  

6. Milestones & Communication  
M1 (T30 s): “Materials at staging”—all players confirm pickups  
M2 (T75 s): “Stair ring up”—P1 signals ready  
M3 (T100 s): “Concrete done”—P2 confirms fill complete  
M4 (T115 s): “Bars in place”—P3 calls “Structure done”  

Focus on sprinting between nodes, minimal inventory juggling, strict adherence to the timeline, and callouts at each milestone to ensure no idle time. This pipeline maximizes parallel work and drives total build time under 2 minutes.
