AIPM Player Instructions - Round 7

==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan – Round 7 (Structure 7)

1. Overview & Distances  
 • Structure @ –20.7,–86.1  
 • Resource area @ +34.4,–83.8 (~55 m east)  
 • Processing area @ –69.4,–84.4 (~49 m west)  
 • Sprint speed ≈5 m/s → 11 s one‐way resource ↔ structure  

2. Resource Collection Strategy  
 Assign 1 “wood” runner (P1), 1 “stairs” runner (P2), 1 “decor” runner (P3).  
 Each does exactly one fully‐loaded run to minimize travel.  

  • P1 (oak logs → logs only)  
    – Collect 57 oak_logs (ceil(145 planks/4)+20 stripped_wood)  
    – Return straight to build pad  

  • P2 (nether brick stairs)  
    – Collect all 48 nether_brick_stairs (each variant in one load)  
    – Return to build pad  

  • P3 (peonies & lanterns)  
    – From “chest” section grab 4 peonies (tall plant yields lower+upper)  
    – From lantern rack grab 12 lanterns  
    – Return to build pad  

3. Processing & Crafting Workflow (at build pad)  
 Set up two portable crafting tables at build pad (carry from processing area or bring from inventory).  
   
  • P1 immediately crafts:  
    – 57 logs→148 planks (~15 s)  
    – Craft 15 fence batches (75 fences)  
    – Craft 9 trapdoor batches (18 trapdoors)  
    – Craft 4 gate batches (4 gates)  
    Total ~35–40 s of crafting, hands P2/P3 partial stacks as needed.  

  • P2 sorts stairs by variant into bundles of their required counts.  
  • P3 pre–slots peonies+lanterns for final pass.  

4. Build Execution Sequence & Parallel Tasks  
 Coordinate on 4 milestones, broadcast on completion (“M1 done,” etc.).  

 M1 (0:00–1:00) – FOUNDATION & FRAME  
  • P1: place 8 oak_planks base + erect 20 stripped_oak_wood columns  
  • P2: unpack stairs bundles at pad edge, begin terrain prep if needed  
  • P3: finish any leftover crafting (minor) & clear workspace  

 M2 (1:00–2:30) – FENCE & GATE INSTALL  
  • P1 & P2 split: P1 runs fence lines clockwise, P2 installs gates at specified faces  
  • P3 hangs crafting table as workstation near center  

 M3 (2:30–4:00) – TRAPDOORS & STAIRS DETAILS  
  • P1 places oak_trapdoors per face (on‐demand from crafting stacks)  
  • P2 installs nether_brick_stairs:  
     – Straight runs first (9 north, 9 east, 9 west, 9 south)  
     – Corners/outer pieces last (2+2+3+1+1+1)  
  • P3 quality‐checks orientation & waterlogging flags  

 M4 (4:00–5:00) – DECORATION & FINAL CHECK  
  • P1 & P2: P3 hands over lanterns → hang 12 in designated spots  
  • P3 places 4 peonies (lower then upper) in planters  
  • All: rapid scan vs blueprint; patch any mis-oriented block  

5. Team Coordination & Checkpoints  
  • Pre-start (“Go!”) all sprint to resource area  
  • On return – immediate split: P1 crafts, P2 sorts, P3 stages decor  
  • Radio “M1 done” at foundation complete → P2/P3 join build  
  • Radio “M2 done,” “M3 done” → shift personnel to next subtask  
  • Final “Done!” when matched exactly – stop clock  

Key to speed: one‐run gathers, on-site crafting, clear role splits, tight milestone calls. Good luck!

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr:

1. PRE-START (0s)  
• Stand ready at X –32.3 Y 77.8 Z –73.1.  
• Sprint key bound—check hunger bar ≥8.

2. STEP A – RESOURCE RUN (0:00–0:20)  
• Sprint east to Resource @ X +34.4 Z –83.8 (≈11 s).  
• Break oak logs until you have exactly 57 in your inventory.  
• Open the chest section here: pull out 4 peonies + 12 lanterns.  
Success: Inventory shows 57 oak_logs, 4 peonies, 12 lanterns.

3. STEP B – PROCESSING RUN (0:20–0:40)  
• Sprint west through build pad to Processing @ X –69.4 Z –84.4 (≈20 s total).  
• Loot exactly 48 nether_brick_stairs from racks/chests.  
Success: +48 nether_brick_stairs added, inventory slots free for build.

4. STEP C – RETURN TO BUILD PAD (0:40–1:00)  
• Sprint to Build pad @ X –20.7 Z –86.1 (≈20 s).  
• Carry 2 portable crafting tables from your inventory (or fetch one from nearby if needed).  
Success: You’re standing on the pad with all materials and 2 crafting tables.

5. STEP D – ON-SITE PROCESSING (1:00–1:40)  
• Place the 2 crafting tables side by side.  
• Using one table, craft 57 oak_logs → 148 oak_planks.  
• Craft from planks:  
   – 15 batches of fences → 75 oak_fences  
   – 9 batches of trapdoors → 18 oak_trapdoors  
   – 4 batches of gates → 4 oak_gates  
• On the second table, sort your 48 nether_brick_stairs into one pile.  
• Lay out 4 peonies and 12 lanterns at the pad edge for final‐build staging.  
Success:  
   – 148 oak_planks converted, fences/trapdoors/gates stacked  
   – 48 nether_brick_stairs grouped  
   – 4 peonies + 12 lanterns staged

➡️ At 1:40 you’re ready to begin M1 foundation & frame. Radio “M1 done” and shift into build steps.
