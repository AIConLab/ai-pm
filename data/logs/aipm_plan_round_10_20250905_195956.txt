==================================================

ROUND 10 — SPEED PLAN (Structure 10)

Overview: Everything is iron + red wall banners. Only two crafted items: iron trapdoors and red banners. Critical path is banner production (48 dyes + 8 crafts).

1) Resource collection priorities and sequence
Immediate pickups (no smelting needed):
- A (Metals runner → Builder):
  - 7x iron_block (for placement)
  - 6x iron_bars
  - Route: Structure → Resource → Structure
  - Pickup order at Resource: iron_block → iron_bars (same Metals aisle; minimizes walking)

- B (Wool/wood + trapdoor iron supplier → Banner crafter):
  - 48x white_wool
  - 1x oak_log (any log)
  - 3x iron_block (for trapdoor crafting)
  - Route: Structure → Resource → Processing
  - Pickup order at Resource: white_wool (Wool aisle) → oak_log (Wood aisle) → iron_block (Metals) → leave immediately for Processing

- C (Processor ready → Trapdoor crafter → Installer):
  - No pickups at Resource
  - Route: Structure → Processing (go immediately)
  - Prep crafting table, open red_dye chest, clear workspace

Inventory notes:
- A: Hotbar: [iron_blocks][iron_bars]; leave 1–2 empty slots for mid-build adjustments.
- B: Stacks: [white_wool 48][oak_log 1][iron_block 3]; ensure 5+ empty slots for dyed wool/banners.
- C: Keep hotbar open for 6 trapdoors on craft, then sprint to Structure.

2) Processing workflow (crafting timeline)
At Processing:
- Hand-off: B arrives and immediately drops 3 iron_blocks to C.
- C crafts trapdoors in parallel:
  - Convert 3 iron_blocks → 27 iron_ingots
  - Craft 6x iron_trapdoor (24 ingots); keep 3 ingots spare (ignore)
  - Depart to Structure with trapdoors as soon as crafted

- B crafts banners:
  - Grab 48x red_dye from chest
  - Dye 48x white_wool → 48x red_wool (shift-click craft)
  - Craft sticks: 1x log → 4 planks → 8 sticks
  - Craft 8x red_banner (6 red_wool + 1 stick each)
  - Depart to Structure with 8 banners

Processing order emphasis:
- C leaves first with trapdoors (fewer clicks) to unblock A’s build.
- B continues dye + banner crafting, then follows.

3) Build execution plan (at Structure)
Placement sequence for speed and orientation control:
- Step 1 (A, immediately on arrival): Place all 7x iron_blocks per blueprint footprint. Keep faces for banners unobstructed.
- Step 2 (A): Place 6x iron_bars per blueprint. Bars auto-connect; confirm exact count.
- Step 3 (C, on arrival): Place 6x iron_trapdoor with exact facings, all closed bottom:
  - 4x facing east
  - 1x facing north
  - 1x facing south
  Tips: Place on top faces so they default to bottom=closed. For reliable facing, look directly toward the required facing direction when placing.
- Step 4 (B, on arrival): Place 8x red_wall_banner:
  - 2x facing north
  - 2x facing south
  - 2x facing east
  - 2x facing west
  Tips: Attach to the correct side of blocks; count out loud as each facing is satisfied.

Final check (all): Verify:
- Iron blocks = 7; bars = 6
- Trapdoors = 6; bottom, closed; facings match exactly (E x4, N x1, S x1)
- Red wall banners = 8; facings: N2, S2, E2, W2
- Call complete immediately after confirmation

4) Team coordination and assignments
Roles:
- A = Iron lead + primary builder (east run → structure)
- B = Banner crafter + final decorator (east run → processing → structure)
- C = Trapdoor crafter + installer (direct to processing → structure)

Movement and timing:
- T0: All at Structure
  - A & B sprint east to Resource
  - C sprints west to Processing
- T0 + ~13s: A/B reach Resource; C at Processing
- T0 + ~25–35s: A back to Structure; C receives 3 iron blocks from B; begins trapdoors; A starts placing iron blocks/bars
- T0 + ~40–55s: C departs Processing with trapdoors → Structure; places trapdoors
- T0 + ~60–80s: B arrives with banners → places all 8; A/C assist orientation check

Communication checkpoints:
- At Resource: B confirms “Got wool/log/3 iron blocks; leaving.”
- At Processing arrival: B tells C “Dropping 3 blocks now.” C confirms “Trapdoors crafting.”
- At Structure: A calls “Iron blocks/bars done” then “Ready for trapdoors.”
- When C places trapdoors: call out facings: “East4, North1, South1 placed.”
- When B places banners: announce counts by facing as you go.

Key milestones
- M1: Resources acquired (A: 7 blocks + 6 bars; B: 48 wool + 1 log + 3 blocks) – leave Resource simultaneously.
- M2: Trapdoors crafted (C) while B is dyeing – C leaves Processing immediately with 6 trapdoors.
- M3: Iron core placed (A) before C arrives; no idle time.
- M4: Trapdoors placed (C), banners crafted (B).
- M5: Banners placed (B) with A/C verifying facing; final audit and submit.

Critical path
- B’s dye + banner crafting + delivery. Keep B uninterrupted at the crafting table; C handles all trapdoors to parallelize.

Optional micro-optimizations
- B: Pre-craft all 8 sticks before dyeing to streamline banner crafting clicks.
- A: Leave clear, flat faces for all 8 banners to avoid rework.
- C: If you arrive before A finishes bars, start trapdoors on accessible faces first.

This plan minimizes trips: one Resource trip for A and B, no Resource trip for C, single Processing stop for B/C, and one delivery each to Structure. Parallel processing removes idle time on the critical path.
