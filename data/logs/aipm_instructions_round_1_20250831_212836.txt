AIPM Player Instructions - Round 1
Generated at: 20250831_212836
==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Summary (goal): finish Structure 1 fastest with 3 players. Key constraints: 25 light_gray_concrete, 20 oak stairs (5 of each facing), 5 isolated iron_bars. Minimize trips by collecting everything in 1 pass per player, parallelize crafting of stairs and conversion of concrete powder, builder starts placing concrete as soon as first delivered.

1) RESOURCE COLLECTION STRATEGY
- Immediate pickup (no processing required):
  - light_gray_concrete_powder: collect 25 (grab 30 for buffer if inventory space allows). Powder is in resource area.
  - iron_bars: collect 5 matching bars if present. If you can’t find the all-false variant, take any iron_bars variant and/or 1 iron_block as a backup to craft bars.
- Needs processing:
  - oak_stairs: not present ready—resource area has oak_log. You must craft planks → stairs.
- Optimal single-trip totals (per team):
  - Oak logs: 8 logs produce 32 planks (needed 30 planks for 20 stairs). Take 9 logs for safety if you can.
  - Light_gray_concrete_powder: 25 (30 buffer)
  - Iron bars: 5 (or 1 iron_block as plan B)
  - Optional: scaffolding (from processing area) if team wants faster vertical placement — grab at processing area, not resource.
- Optimal collection sequence to minimize walking:
  1. All 3 spawn/start sprint to resource area simultaneously.
  2. Each player takes a dedicated subset so only one player visits processing area to craft/convert while others start moving materials toward the build site:
     - Player R (Runner): collects oak_logs (8–9), all light_gray_concrete_powder (25–30), iron_bars (5) or iron_block backup. Immediately heads to Processing area.
     - Player P (Processing/Support): stays at Processing area (or arrives second) at the crafting table/water station ready to process incoming materials.
     - Player B (Builder): grabs minimal items needed to start placement immediately (e.g., 1 stack of powder or a few slabs of concrete if any ready) or positions at structure to set anchor points. If no processed materials available, Player B goes to resource and brings extra powder/stairs backup to structure zone.
- Inventory management:
  - Runner keeps heavy-stackable items in single hotbar slots (powder in one slot, logs in another).
  - Processor reserves hotbar slots for stairs and concrete output (2–3 hotbar slots).
  - Builder keeps placement items in all 9 hotbar slots (concrete + stairs + iron bars) and one slot for scaffolding.

2) PROCESSING WORKFLOW (who does what, when)
- What needs processing:
  - Oak_logs → oak_planks → oak_stairs (crafting table).
  - Light_gray_concrete_powder → light_gray_concrete (water contact).
  - If iron_bars not match required state: iron_block → 9 iron_ingots (crafting) → iron_bars (craft 6 ingots → 16 bars) as backup.
- Processing order & timing (critical path = stairs + concrete conversion):
  1. Immediately convert concrete powder to concrete: Processor places a single-row water trough (use processing area water/bucket) and dumps/places all powder blocks onto the water. Conversion is instantaneous and fast. Put concrete blocks into a single chest slot or carried stacks for Builder pickup. This should be done first because concrete is the largest block count to place and builder should not wait.
  2. Parallel: craft stairs from logs. Each 6 planks → 4 stairs. Processor crafts planks from logs (1 log = 4 planks), then craft stairs in batches. With 8 logs (32 planks) you craft five batches (needs 30 planks) to produce 20 stairs. Keep stairs in hotbar for quick handoff.
  3. Iron bar backup: If necessary, Processor crafts iron_ingots from iron_block (crafting bench) and crafts iron_bars; otherwise skip.
- Player assignment at processing:
  - Processor (P): stays at processing area, converts all powder to concrete, crafts stairs in continuous batches, prepares stacks for Builder to carry directly.
  - Runner (R): fetches materials from resource, delivers to Processor quickly, returns to structure to carry processed bundles or to help place blocks.
  - Builder (B): stages at structure to receive first deliveries. As soon as concrete arrives, Builder begins placement in parallel with Processor still crafting stairs.

3) BUILD EXECUTION PLAN (placement order, parallel tasks)
- Construction sequence for speed:
  1. Layout/anchor: Builder places any alignment markers (two distinct corner blocks) immediately on first arrival to ensure orientation for stairs (so stairs face correct directions).
  2. Concrete first: place the 25 light_gray_concrete blocks first (large contiguous area/structural elements). This provides stable surfaces and is fastest to place. Builder should place as Processor is still producing stairs.
  3. Stairs second: place oak_stairs in required faces (5 per direction). Because these are directional, Builder must place them with care — have stair counts and facing noted. Do these while other players finish off concrete or iron bars.
  4. Iron bars last: place the 5 iron_bars as isolated bars (ensure no neighboring connecting blocks so blockstate is all-false). Place last to avoid accidental connections while placing surrounding blocks.
- Parallel work opportunities:
  - While Processor crafts stairs, Builder places converted concrete.
  - Runner shuttles processed stacks from Processing → Structure continuously, and can place too when deliveries are caught up.
  - When stairs are being crafted in multiple batches, hand off completed stairs in small stacks (4–8) to Builder for immediate placement (keep stairs in hotbar).
- Critical path:
  - Concrete conversion (fast but must be done before heavy placement).
  - Crafting stairs (multiple craft steps) — this typically dominates time; make sure Processor focuses exclusively on this while Runner shuttles processed concrete to Builder.

4) TEAM COORDINATION (roles, comms, milestones)
- Roles (3 players):
  - Player P (Processor/Crafter): Starting position — Processing area. Main job: convert powder to concrete, craft stairs, make iron bars if needed. Keep items in hotbar for quick handoff.
  - Player R (Runner/Logistics): Starting position — Resource area. Main job: collect resource stack (logs, powder, iron bars/iron_block), deliver to Processor quickly, shuttle processed stacks to Builder, act as backup placer.
  - Player B (Builder/Finisher): Starting position — Structure location. Main job: place concrete as soon as first stacks arrive, place stairs with correct facing, place iron bars, final verify.
- Communication checkpoints (use short calls):
  - “Resource loaded” (Runner → Processor): Runner has delivered logs/powder/iron.
  - “Powder converted” (Processor → Builder & Runner): concrete ready; send first stack.
  - “Stairs batch X done” (Processor → Builder): indicate how many stairs ready (e.g., “Batch1:4, Batch2:8”).
  - “Placing half” (Builder → Team): 50% concrete/stairs placed.
  - “Iron bars ready/placed” (Processor/Builder): final step.
  - “Check” (Builder): verify orientation counts and isolated iron_bars, then call “Done”.
- Milestones (with quick acceptance checks):
  1. M1 — Materials at Processing: logs + powder + iron delivered (confirm).
  2. M2 — Concrete converted and first 10 concrete delivered to Builder (start placing).
  3. M3 — Stairs finished (20) and being delivered in handable batches to Builder.
  4. M4 — Concrete 100% placed.
  5. M5 — Stairs 100% placed with correct facings and counts.
  6. M6 — Iron bars placed and final check passed.
- Small verification checklist before finish:
  - Concrete blocks = 25 (count).
  - Oak stairs each facing count: south 5, east 5, west 5, north 5.
  - Iron bars 5 with all-false connections (no adjacent connectable blocks).

5) Quick contingency rules
- If the exact iron_bars state isn’t available: use iron_block → craft ingots → craft iron_bars at Processor. Priority: don’t delay concrete; maker of iron bars works only after first concrete batch is converted and stairs crafting is in pipeline.
- If Processor falls behind on stairs crafting: Runner drops extra logs directly at structure with spare crafting table? (less ideal) — better keep Processor dedicated to crafting.
- If a player finishes early, they should help the Builder place blocks or shuttle small stacks to reduce the Builder’s walking/time.

Execution cadence (practical sequence to start round)
1. T=0: All run to resource.
   - R collects: 9 oak_logs, 30 light_gray_concrete_powder, 5 iron_bars or 1 iron_block backup.
   - P moves to processing table and water trough (ready).
   - B moves to structure and places markers.
2. R → P: deliver logs/powder/iron to Processor ASAP.
3. P: Immediately convert powder into concrete pool; fill inventories for Builder; concurrently start crafting stairs from logs.
4. R: shuttle first concrete stacks to Builder; help carry more as P finishes stairs batches.
5. B: place concrete immediately; when stairs arrive, place them with orientation; place iron bars last; call final check.

Final optimizations (speed tips)
- Use sprint + boatless sprint on flat ground between sites. Short cuts on terrain: keep straight-line runs (resource → processing → structure).
- Keep all processed items in hotbar (quick access) for instant placement.
- Handoff method: Processor places completed stacks in single chest at Processing area for Runner pickup only if handoff slows you; otherwise Runner takes directly from Processor’s hands to avoid chest interactions.
- Pre-agree on exact block coordinates/facing sequence so Builder never hesitates. Builder should get counts printed on sign or told numerically before placement.

If you want, I can convert this into an explicit per-player step-by-step 30–second tick-by-tick plan for a perfect run (who moves at each second and which slot to hold).

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr: Start now — sprint to the resource area and collect 30 light_gray_concrete_powder, 9 oak_logs, and 5 iron_bars (if matching bars aren’t present take any iron_bars variant and/or 1 iron_block as backup). jc_cr: After collecting, run directly to the Processing area (crafting table + water trough) and unload materials there; immediately convert powder to concrete by creating a water trough and touching powder to water — convert at least 10 concrete first to carry to the Build area and then convert the remaining powder. jc_cr: While the concrete conversion is running, craft planks from the 9 logs (9 logs -> 36 planks) and craft oak_stairs in batches until you have 20 stairs; keep stairs in your hotbar for instant placement. jc_cr: If you could not pick up 5 iron_bars, craft iron_ingots from the iron_block and make iron_bars as a backup only after the first concrete batch and while stair crafting continues. jc_cr: Move to the Build area and place two alignment markers to lock orientation, then place the initial 10 concrete immediately to begin Structure 1; continue shuttling and placing the remaining concrete until all 25 are placed (target: 25 concrete placed). jc_cr: Place the 20 oak stairs with exact facings: 5 north, 5 south, 5 east, 5 west — confirm counts as you place; keep stair stacks in hotbar slots for quick directional placement. jc_cr: Place the 5 iron_bars last, ensuring each iron_bar is isolated with no adjacent connectable blocks (all-false state). jc_cr: Use this milestone checklist and callouts to self: M1 Materials at Processing (confirm 9 logs, 30 powder, 5 bars/iron_block). M2 At least 10 concrete converted and delivered to Build. M3 20 stairs crafted. M4 25 concrete placed. M5 Stairs placed with correct facings. M6 5 iron_bars placed and final check passed. jc_cr: Hotbar management — reserve one slot for concrete stacks, 2–3 slots for stairs, one slot for iron bars, one slot for scaffolding if available; avoid chest handoffs unless necessary to save time. jc_cr: Contingencies — if inventory fills, drop non-essential items at Processing chest and resume; if stairs crafting lags, prioritize finishing stairs before crafting iron bars; if other players join, hand off processing to them immediately. jc_cr: Execute immediately and use short chat calls for progress: “Resource loaded”, “Powder converted”, “Stairs batch done”, “Placing half”, “Iron bars placed”, “Done”.
