AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 10
Generated at: 20250902_011947
==================================================

Summary (goal): Finish Structure 10 fastest by (1) one dedicated runner/processor fetching all craftable materials in a single trip, (2) two builders immediately placing everything that doesn’t require crafting, and (3) overlapping processing (trapdoors + banners) with active block placement. Critical path = crafting 6 iron trapdoors and 8 red wall banners — start these immediately and overlap them with building.

1) Resource collection priorities
- Immediate pickup (take to structure ASAP):
  - 7 iron_block (for direct placement)
  - All required iron_bars (grab the exact variants listed) — stackable, take them all in one trip
- Pickup for processing (convert/craft):
  - 3 iron_block (to convert → 27 iron ingots → craft 6 iron_trapdoors)
  - 48 white_wool (craft 8 white banners)
  - 1 oak_log (or equivalent) → convert to planks → craft 8 sticks for banners
- Processing-area supplies (grab/use there):
  - red_dye (from processing area chest)
  - crafting_table(s) already at processing area
Notes on inventories: everything fits easily in 1–3 slots (iron blocks, wool, iron bars). Plan for a single runner to carry everything in one trip to minimize walking.

2) Processing workflow (order and timing)
- Immediately after first drop-off at structure:
  - Runner proceeds to processing area ([-69.365,66,-84.426]) with 3 iron_blocks, 48 wool, 1 log.
  - At crafting table:
    1. Convert 3 iron_blocks → 27 iron_ingots (shapeless craft).
    2. Craft 6 iron_trapdoors (each = 4 ingots). Put trapdoors into one inventory slot for quick delivery.
    3. Convert log → planks → craft sticks (need 8 sticks).
    4. Craft 8 white banners (6 wool + 1 stick each).
    5. Dye 8 white banners → red banners (use red_dye).
- Order rationale: trapdoors and banners are the bottleneck; do them first and in parallel while builders place iron_blocks + iron_bars.
- Player assignment for processing: Runner/Processor (single person) performs all these steps. Use both crafting table and second crafting table if available to speed parallel crafting (one person can still do sequentially faster than extra trips).

3) Build execution plan (fastest sequence + parallelism)
- Start conditions: Runner hangs 7 iron_blocks and all iron_bars at the structure before heading to processing area.
- Construction sequence (parallel):
  - Builders immediately:
    1. Place the 7 iron_blocks into assigned locations (split structure into two halves; each builder handles one half).
    2. Place all iron_bars into their precise positions/orientations (bar variants already match; builders place them where indicated).
    3. Prepare mounting positions for trapdoors and banners (leave blocks in place/walls clear).
  - When Runner returns with trapdoors + banners:
    4. Place 6 iron_trapdoors into prepped positions (fast one-player job—builders can place together).
    5. Place 8 red_wall_banners in required facings (orientation set by wall placement).
    6. Quick final check, adjust any mis-rotated placements (builders handle final fine placements).
- Critical path: processing of trapdoors & banners. Ensure Runner starts processing immediately after first drop-off and returns fast to place those items—builders must not idle; they place everything else first.

4) Team coordination and task allocation
- Ideal 3-player assignment:
  - Player A (Runner/Processor): Single trip to resource area → drop 7 blocks + bars at structure → go to processing → craft trapdoors + banners → return to structure and hand off. Primary responsibility: keep pipeline filled.
  - Player B (Lead builder): Immediately places left half of structure (iron_blocks + iron_bars), calls placements and checks blueprint alignment, places trapdoors/banners when delivered.
  - Player C (Support builder): Immediately places right half, mirrors Lead, attends to details and final checks.
- 2-player fallback (current team: BT1013, jc_cr):
  - Assign jc_cr = Runner/Processor (or the less involved builder based on comfort). jc_cr collects resources, drops placement blocks, processes trapdoors/banners, returns.
  - Assign BT1013 = Primary builder + partial runner help: start placing all iron_blocks and iron_bars immediately; when jc_cr returns with processed items, both place trapdoors/banners and finalize. If one player is faster runner, swap roles.
- Communication checkpoints (short, exact callouts):
  1. “Resources obtained — dropping at structure” (Runner)
  2. “Processing started — expected return in ~X s” (Runner)
  3. “Base blocks 50% placed” / “Base blocks complete” (Builders)
  4. “Trapdoors ready” / “Banners ready” (Runner)
  5. “All placements complete — final check” (Lead)
- Suggested short voice commands: “DROP”, “PROCESS”, “HALF”, “TRAP”, “BANNER”, “CHECK”.

5) Milestones (for progress tracking, minimal text)
- M1 (T+0): Runner returns with initial supply and drops 7 iron_blocks + iron_bars at structure — Builders start placement immediately.
- M2 (T+start of processing): Runner begins crafting trapdoors and banners at processing area.
- M3 (Base placement): Builders complete >90% of iron_block + iron_bars placements (no waiting for crafted items).
- M4 (Return): Runner returns with 6 trapdoors + 8 red banners.
- M5 (Finish): Trapdoors + banners placed and final verification done — structure complete.

Extra efficiency tips
- Single-run approach: because items stack, one runner can fetch everything in a single trip; do not split multiple collection trips.
- Drop-off strategy: Runner drops placement-ready items first at structure before processing so builders can start immediately.
- Use processing-area crafting_table only; no need to smelt. Use both crafting tables if multiple people end up at processing area.
- Avoid unnecessary inventory juggling—place items into a single “staging block” area at the build site (a 2×2 floor tile) so builders can grab quickly.
- If only two players, reduce runner travel time by sprinting and using scaffolding from processing area if small vertical moves are needed. Keep calls short.

Concise checklist for execution right now
1. Decide runner (who will go to [34.398,65,-83.75] then processing [-69.365,66,-84.426]) — one trip.
2. Runner collects: 10 iron_blocks (7 place + 3 for trapdoors), all required iron_bars, 48 white_wool, 1 log.
3. Runner returns, drops 7 iron_blocks + iron_bars at structure and announces “DROP/GO PROCESS”.
4. Builders immediately divide structure and start placing iron_blocks + iron_bars.
5. Runner crafts trapdoors and banners, returns with them, announces “TRAP/BANNER”.
6. Builders place trapdoors & banners, call “CHECK” and finalize.

Follow this plan exactly to minimize walking and maximize overlap between processing and placement — that is the fastest route to completion.
