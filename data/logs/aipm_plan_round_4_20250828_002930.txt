AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 4
Generated at: 20250828_002930
==================================================

Strategic Plan – Round 4 (Structure 4)  
Players: P1, P2, P3  
Start: all at build site, empty inventories  

1. Resource Collection Priorities  
  • P1 (Iron Specialist) – Resource Area → Processing  
    – Grab 25× minecraft:iron_block  
    – Carry straight to processing area  
  • P2 (Concrete Specialist) – Resource Area  
    – Grab 19× minecraft:orange_concrete_powder  
    – Grab 1× minecraft:bucket, 16× scaffolding  
    – Return to build site  
  • P3 (Accessory Specialist) – Resource Area → Build Site  
    – Grab 4× minecraft:redstone_torch (lit)  
    – Grab any extra redstone dust/levers if available for “powered” trapdoor state (optional)  
    – Grab 12× minecraft:iron_block for final build (to minimize re‐crafting later)  

2. Processing Workflow (at Processing Area)  
  • P1 immediately:  
    1. Place crafting table, decraft 25 iron blocks → 225 iron ingots.  
    2. Craft required components:  
       – 27× iron_trapdoor (4 ingots→1 each)  
       – 1× iron_door (6 ingots→1)  
    3. Stock leftover ingots for final iron_block recrafting.  
    4. Craft 12× iron_block from 108 ingots.  
    5. Deliver finished trapdoors, doors, and 12 iron blocks to build site.  

  • P2: Skip processing area; head straight to build site to set up concrete conversion station.  

  • P3: No processing needed; head to build site to stockpile redstone torches and iron blocks.  

3. Build Execution Sequence  
  Milestone 1 (T+20s): All raw materials on site  
    – P1 at site with: 27 trapdoors, 1 iron door, 12 iron blocks  
    – P2 at site with: 19 orange powder, bucket, scaffolding  
    – P3 at site with: 4 redstone torches  

  Phase A – Concrete Conversion (parallel)  
    • P2 builds a 19-block scaffold row adjacent to a single water source (use bucket on a 1×1 pit).  
    • P2 places all 19 orange powder blocks against water → instant-convert to orange concrete.  
    • P2 hands off converted blocks to P3/P1 as they’re ready.  

  Phase B – Foundation & Shell (P1 + P3)  
    • P1 lays out all 12 iron blocks in blueprint positions (corners/structural accents).  
    • P3 lays all 19 orange concrete blocks in floor/wall positions, following blueprint row by row.  

  Phase C – Doors & Trapdoors (P1 + P3)  
    • P1 places the iron door in its exact orientation (north-facing, hinge right).  
    • P1 installs 27 trapdoors in specified faces/orientations.  
      – Use P3 to hand each trapdoor in sequence to eliminate inventory juggling.  
    • P3 immediately steps on a lever or places redstone dust + torch to “power” the trapdoors that must be powered/open.  

  Phase D – Redstone Torches & Final Touches (P3)  
    • P3 places 4× redstone_torch in exact positions.  
    • P3 runs a quick visual check; P1 & P2 cross-check block counts and orientations.  

4. Team Coordination & Checkpoints  
  – Checkpoint A (T+20s): “Materials ready – go!”  
  – Checkpoint B (T+60s): P1 signals “processing done,” hands over components.  
  – Checkpoint C (T+90s): P2 signals “all concrete on site.”  
  – Checkpoint D (T+130s): Foundation + shell complete.  
  – Checkpoint E (T+160s): Doors/trapdoors/torches in place.  
  – Checkpoint F (T+180s): Final audit – orientation, block count, redstone state.  

Key Tips  
  • Never idle: as soon as P1 finishes a batch of ingots/programming, start crafting next component.  
  • Keep inventories light: use hand-off method—one player carries trapdoors/doors, another installs.  
  • Parallelize: P2’s concrete conversion is entirely independent of P1’s processing.  
  • Communication: call out “Block complete,” “Trapdoor ready,” “Torch placed” to synchronize.  

This plan minimizes travel by dedicating one player to each critical path (iron, concrete, finishing) and uses strict milestones to keep everyone moving at top speed.
