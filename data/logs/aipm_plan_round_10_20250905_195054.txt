==================================================

ROUND 10 – SPEED PLAN (Structure 10)

Core idea: Split iron base vs. crafted components. Two builders place all iron blocks and bars while one crafter produces trapdoors and banners, then joins to finish.

1) Resource collection priorities and routes
Immediate pickups (no smelting):
- Iron blocks: 10 total
  - 7 for placement
  - 3 to craft 6 iron trapdoors (3 blocks → 27 ingots → 6 trapdoors)
- Iron bars: 6
- White wool: 48 (to dye into 48 red wool)
- Oak log: 1 (for sticks → banners)

Optimal collection and delivery split:
- P1 (Resource → Structure):
  - Grab 4 iron blocks + 3 iron bars (plus 1 extra bar if you want buffer)
  - Head straight to structure
- P3 (Resource → Structure):
  - Grab 3 iron blocks + 3 iron bars
  - Head straight to structure
- P2 (Resource → Processing → Structure):
  - Grab 3 iron blocks + 48 white wool + 1 oak log
  - Sprint to Processing to craft, then deliver to Structure
Inventory tips:
- Keep hotbar light and sorted: 1) iron blocks 2) bars 3) trapdoors 4) banners
- P2: craft planks and sticks on the run (2x2) to shorten processing time

2) Processing workflow (P2)
At Processing:
- Pull a stack of red dye
- Pre-crafts (can do while traveling):
  - 1 oak log → 4 planks → 8 sticks (2 planks → 4 sticks; you need 8 sticks total)
At crafting table:
- Dye 48 white wool → 48 red wool
- Craft 8 red banners (6 red wool + 1 stick each)
- Convert 3 iron blocks → 27 ingots
- Craft 6 iron trapdoors (4 ingots each; 24 ingots used)
Depart immediately to Structure with: 8 red banners + 6 iron trapdoors (+ leftover ingots)

Processing timing priority:
- Make trapdoors first if you arrive early and builders are nearly done with the base; otherwise banners first is fine. Both are fast—travel is the critical path.

3) Build execution plan (at Structure)
Critical path: P2’s craft and delivery. P1/P3 must fully finish all iron placement before P2 arrives.

Order for fastest completion:
- Phase A (P1 + P3, in parallel)
  - Place all 7 iron blocks (coordinate with each other to avoid collision)
  - Place all 6 iron bars (match reference exactly; verify connections after adjacent blocks go in)
- Phase B (upon P2 arrival)
  - Place iron trapdoors (6 total):
    - All trapdoors are half=bottom and closed
    - Facing east: 4
    - Facing north: 1
    - Facing south: 1
    Placement technique (to guarantee states):
    - Click the lower half of the correct side face of the supporting block:
      - Facing east: click the EAST face (lower half)
      - Facing north: click the NORTH face (lower half)
      - Facing south: click the SOUTH face (lower half)
    - Do not toggle after placing (must remain closed)
  - Place red wall banners (8 total):
    - Facing N: 2 on north faces
    - Facing S: 2 on south faces
    - Facing E: 2 on east faces
    - Facing W: 2 on west faces
- Phase C (finalize)
  - Quick 360° verification of trapdoor facings, banner facings, iron bar connections, and iron block count

4) Team coordination and assignments
Roles:
- P1: Iron base lead
  - Route: Resource → Structure
  - Place 4 iron blocks + 3 bars
- P3: Iron base support + QA
  - Route: Resource → Structure
  - Place 3 iron blocks + 3 bars; then pre-mark locations for trapdoors/banners (stand at blocks and call out faces)
- P2: Crafter/finisher
  - Route: Resource → Processing (craft) → Structure (deliver and place)
  - Place all 6 trapdoors (fastest single-placer for consistency); then place banners
Parallel opportunities:
- P1 and P3 place blocks simultaneously on opposite sides of the structure to avoid collision
- While waiting for P2, P1/P3 pre-aim crosshairs at the exact trapdoor faces to reduce P2’s placement hesitation

5) Communication checkpoints (short calls)
- “Base iron down” (P1/P3): All 7 iron blocks placed
- “Bars done” (P1/P3): All 6 bars placed and checked
- “Crafts en route” (P2): Leaving Processing with trapdoors + banners
- “Trapdoors placed” (P2): All 6 done; request banner placements
- “Banners placed” (P2 or helper): All 8 placed
- “360 check clear” (Anyone): All orientations and counts verified

6) Milestones for tracking
- M1: 7/7 iron blocks placed (target: before P2 arrives)
- M2: 6/6 iron bars placed (target: before P2 arrives)
- M3: P2 arrival with 6 trapdoors + 8 banners
- M4: 6/6 trapdoors placed with correct facing and bottom half
- M5: 8/8 red wall banners placed with correct facing
- M6: Final orientation/connection check complete → submit

Notes to prevent mistakes
- Trapdoors: always click lower half of the correct side face; avoid right-clicking again
- Banners: must be red banners (crafted from red wool); place on the correct wall face for exact facing
- Bars: if connections don’t match reference, adjust surrounding placements; bars auto-update connections

This plan minimizes trips, parallelizes base placement, and keeps the single longest leg (P2’s crafting/delivery) off the critical path by having the entire iron foundation done before arrival.
