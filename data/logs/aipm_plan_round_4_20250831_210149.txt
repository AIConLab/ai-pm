AIPM High-Level Plan - Round 4
Generated at: 20250831_210149
==================================================

Round 4 – Single-Structure Speed Plan (optimized for current solo play, with 2–3 player scaling)

1) Resource collection priorities (from Structure ➜ Resource ➜ Processing ➜ Build)
- One run, all materials in one carry.
- From Resource area [34.4, 65, -83.8], grab:
  - Iron blocks: 26 (12 for placement, 14 to convert → 126 ingots for 27 trapdoors + doors; leaves small buffer)
  - Orange concrete powder: 19
  - Redstone torches (from chest): 4
- Inventory/hotbar pack for speed:
  - Slot 1: iron blocks (for placement)
  - Slot 2: orange concrete powder (to process)
  - Slot 3: iron blocks (to convert to ingots)
  - Slot 9: redstone torches (to place last)
- Travel route to minimize time: Start at Structure [-20.7,…] ➜ sprint east to Resource (≈ +55 X) ➜ sprint west past Structure to Processing [-69.4,…] (≈ -90 X) ➜ sprint east to Structure (≈ +49 X).

2) Processing workflow (fastest order, solo)
- At Processing:
  - Grab netherite pickaxe (from chest) for faster concrete mining.
  - Crafting:
    - Convert 14 iron blocks → 126 ingots (2x2 grid or crafting table).
    - Craft 27 iron trapdoors (4 ingots each).
    - Craft 1 batch of iron doors (6 ingots → 3 doors; you’ll use 1).
  - Concrete:
    - Use water source: place 19 orange concrete powder into/against flowing water, mine with netherite pickaxe to collect 19 orange concrete quickly. Keep the stream compact to minimize cursor travel.
- Sort hotbar for build:
  - 1: orange concrete (19)
  - 2: iron blocks (12)
  - 3: iron door (1)
  - 4–7: iron trapdoors (all 27; orientation set on placement)
  - 9: redstone torches (4)

3) Build execution plan (critical path first)
- Goal: place static blocks first, then all unpowered interactives, then power with torches last to set final states.
- Sequence:
  1) Place all orange concrete (19) and iron blocks (12) per blueprint footprint/walls. Use minimal movement: place in rings/rows to avoid backtracking.
  2) Place the iron door (faces north, hinge=right). Tip: Stand south of the doorway looking north; aim/click to set hinge on the east side (right relative to facing north). Do not power yet.
  3) Place all iron trapdoors (27) with correct facing and bottom half. Don’t worry about open state yet—iron trapdoors require power to open:
     - Closed sets: 
       - East-facing: 6 (open=false, powered=false)
       - North-facing: 12 (open=false, powered=false)
     - Will-open sets (to be powered): 
       - East-facing: 4 (open=true, powered=true)
       - West-facing: 4 (open=true, powered=true)
       - South-facing: 1 (open=true, powered=true)
  4) Place the 4 redstone torches at their blueprint positions. This simultaneously:
     - Powers/open the 9 trapdoors that must be open (and keeps closed sets unpowered).
     - Powers/opens the iron door (open=true, powered=true).
  5) Verify all facings and states match exactly; adjust trapdoor orientation if any is off before placing torches. Final micro-check: counts—12 iron blocks, 19 orange concrete, 27 trapdoors with the exact split, 4 redstone torches, iron door open and powered.

Critical path
- Craft trapdoors + make concrete + final torch placement. Any delay in these three gates extends total time. Keep the torches for the very end to “lock in” correct powered/open states.

4) Team coordination (current: solo; scaling to 2–3 players)

Solo (current: jc_cr)
- Run 1 (Structure ➜ Resource ➜ Processing): collect all → craft trapdoors/door → make concrete.
- Run 2 (Processing ➜ Structure): full build per sequence above.
- Communications: quick self-checkpoints (counts before leaving each area).

If 2 players become active mid-round
- Player A (Runner/Builder): Do current solo plan.
- Player B (Processor/Prep):
  - Go directly to Processing now, prep water setup, pull netherite tools, ready crafting table.
  - As A arrives: B crafts trapdoors/door while A hardens concrete (or vice versa).
  - Both return to Structure together; A places static blocks, B follows with trapdoors then torches.
- Checkpoints:
  - At Processing: confirm 27 trapdoors, 1 door, 19 concrete.
  - At Structure: confirm trapdoor facings before torches go down.

If full 3 players
- Player 1 (Runner): Resource pickup (26 iron blocks, 19 orange concrete powder, 4 redstone torches), sprint to Processing.
- Player 2 (Crafter): At Processing, craft trapdoors and door immediately on arrival.
- Player 3 (Concrete/Builder): Make 19 orange concrete, grab netherite pick, then both 2 and 3 sprint to Structure with Player 1.
- Build split:
  - P1 lays iron blocks.
  - P3 lays orange concrete.
  - P2 places door and all trapdoors by facing group (closed sets first), then P1 places torches last.
- Checkpoints:
  - Processing done: “27 traps, door, 19 concrete” callout.
  - Before torches: “Trapdoor facing check complete” callout.

Milestones for progress tracking
- M1 (Resource depart): 26 iron blocks, 19 orange concrete powder, 4 redstone torches in inventory.
- M2 (Processing complete): 27 iron trapdoors, 1 iron door, 19 orange concrete in hotbar; remaining iron blocks ≥12 for placement.
- M3 (Structure midway): All orange concrete + 12 iron blocks placed.
- M4 (Pre-power): All trapdoors placed with correct facing and “bottom” half; iron door placed correctly (north, hinge right).
- M5 (Finish): 4 redstone torches placed; verify all powered/open states match target; final count check.

Notes to avoid time loss
- Don’t place torches until all trapdoors are oriented; powered trapdoors are harder to reorient quickly.
- Keep at least one spare trapdoor and a few ingots if possible (buffer).
- Use sprint-jump in straight lines; avoid opening inventory mid-run.
- If any trapdoor set appears mistakenly powered, remove nearby torch first, fix orientation, then re-place torch.

This plan minimizes trips (one full gather/process loop), compresses processing into one stop, and locks critical states with torches at the end for a fast, clean finish.
