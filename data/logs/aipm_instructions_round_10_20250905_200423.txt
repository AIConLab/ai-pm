==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Below is a compact, high‑efficiency plan for a 3‑player team to finish Structure 10 as fast as possible. It assumes standard inventory sizes and the given resource/processing locations. Focus: minimize trips, keep builders always building, and make the Processor the single bottleneck who does all crafting in one stop.

Quick summary of items needed (explicit counts used in plan)
- Iron blocks total to collect: 9 (7 placed in build + 2 to convert to ingots for trapdoors)
- Iron bars: 6 (take matching orientation variants from resource area)
- Iron trapdoors: 6 (must be crafted from iron ingots — 4 ingots → 2 trapdoors each craft; need 12 ingots → convert 2 iron_blocks into ingots)
- Red wall banners: 8 (make from white_wool + sticks then recolor with red_dye)
- White wool: 48 (6 wool × 8 banners)
- Sticks: 8 (1 per banner; craft from planks — logs available)

1) RESOURCE COLLECTION STRATEGY
- Immediate collection (no processing needed):
  - Iron blocks (collect 9 total)
  - Iron bars (6) — pick variants that match the required orientations when possible to avoid re-orienting at build
  - Extra spare blocks: +1 iron_block (if inventory allows) as a contingency
- Collected for processing (one player only):
  - 2 iron_blocks (for ingots → trapdoors)
  - 48 white_wool
  - 2 logs (to craft planks → sticks) OR collect planks/sticks if available
  - (Optional) a few extra wool/sticks for mistakes
- Optimal collection sequence (minimize trips):
  - Players A & B: each collect majority of iron_blocks + each take half the iron_bars, then go straight to the structure and begin building.
  - Player C (Processor/Runner): collect the 2 iron_blocks + all white_wool + logs/sticks (and any leftover bars if needed) in one trip, then go directly to the processing area to craft everything in one stop.
- Inventory distribution example:
  - Player A: 5 iron_blocks, 3 iron_bars
  - Player B: 4 iron_blocks, 3 iron_bars (+ any scaffolding if needed)
  - Player C: 2 iron_blocks (for conversion), 48 white_wool, 2 logs (or 8 sticks if pre-crafted) — everything needed for banners & trapdoors

2) PROCESSING WORKFLOW (order + who)
- All processing done by Player C at the Processing Area (single processor avoids duplicated trips).
- Steps and timing:
  1. At processing table: convert 2 iron_blocks → 18 iron_ingots (place blocks in crafting grid; yields 9 each).
  2. Craft iron trapdoors: perform the trapdoor recipe 3 times (4 ingots → 2 trapdoors) to get the required 6 trapdoors. This is fast; do all three crafts back-to-back.
  3. Craft sticks from logs → planks → sticks (2 logs → 8+ sticks easily).
  4. Craft 8 white banners: 8 × (6 white_wool + 1 stick) → produce 8 white banners. (Crafting is instant.)
  5. Recolor banners: combine each white banner + red_dye → red banner (processing area has red_dye). Make them wall‑banners in place later (orientation done on placement).
- Timing note: all crafting is local at processing area; Player C should batch everything in one processing stop to avoid repeat travel. Expect processing walk + crafting + run to structure to be the critical path.

3) BUILD EXECUTION PLAN (fastest order + parallelization)
- Build critical path: iron block frame → iron bars → trapdoors/banners final placement.
- Construction sequence:
  1. Structural block placement (parallel): Players A & B immediately place the 7 iron_blocks (and any support blocks) to create the attachment points for bars, trapdoors, banners. They should split the structure into clear halves: A handles left/half, B handles right/half so no overlap.
  2. Iron bars (parallel): While blocks are being placed (or immediately after), A & B place the 6 iron_bars into their exact positions. If bars are already oriented correctly from the resource area, placement is quick.
  3. Final fittings (sequential but quick): Player C arrives with trapdoors and red banners. Player C coordinates with whichever builder is closest to place trapdoors with correct facing attributes (east/north/south) — trapdoors must be oriented as specified on placement. Player C can also apply banners (wall banners must face proper direction), or hand them to the closest builder if placing on the opposite side is faster.
  4. Final cleanup & verification (single pass): One player walks the structure verifying orientation & exactness.
- Parallel work opportunities:
  - A and B continuously place iron_blocks and iron_bars in parallel (primary parallel work).
  - Player C processing is parallel to that; builders should not wait—start block/bar work immediately.
  - Once Player C arrives with trapdoors/banners, placement can be parallel: C places trapdoors while A/B place banners and final adjustments.
- Critical path identification:
  - Critical path: Player C’s resource → processing → travel → placement of trapdoors & banners. Everything else should be done before C’s arrival so final placement completes fast.
  - Avoidance: Do not send builders to processing unless there is idle time — processing is far; keep them building.

4) TEAM COORDINATION (roles, comms, milestones)
- Roles (3 players):
  - Player A: Builder 1 — collects 5 iron_blocks + 3 iron_bars → goes straight to structure → places iron_blocks and half of iron_bars → after C arrives, place assigned banners/trapdoors on assigned side.
  - Player B: Builder 2 — collects 4 iron_blocks + 3 iron_bars → goes straight to structure → mirrors Player A on other half.
  - Player C: Processor/Runner — collects 2 iron_blocks (for ingots), 48 white_wool, logs → runs to processing area → crafts trapdoors & banners → runs to structure and completes trapdoors & banners placement and final tweaks.
- Communication checkpoints (short, exact phrases):
  - “Collected” — when each player finishes resource pickup.
  - “A/B at build” — builders confirm they began placing.
  - “C at processing / crafting” — processor announces start of crafting.
  - “C out with banners/trapdoors” — processor leaving processing for structure.
  - “Ready for placement [east/north/south]” — when C arrives, call out where trapdoors/banners will be placed.
  - “Final check” — once done, a quick sweep for exactness.
- Milestones (use these as timers/checkpoints)
  - M1 (T+0): A/B depart resource → begin placing blocks within 10s of arrival at structure.
  - M2 (T+0 + few secs): C arrives at processing — starts crafting (goal: finished crafting within ~20–45s depending on sprint times).
  - M3 (Before M4): A & B have all iron_blocks and iron_bars placed or nearly done.
  - M4 (C arrival at structure): C arrives with trapdoors + banners — place final pieces immediately (this should finish the structure).
  - M5 (Immediate): Final verification and corrections (max 10s).
- Contingency: if C is delayed, builders should pre-place bar anchor points and keep the structure waiting for items to be attached; do not send a builder to process unless both builders are done and idle.

Other micro-optimizations
- Choose iron_bar variants pre-matched to the orientation required to avoid rotating in-place.
- Builders should carry quick scaffolding if needed (scaffolding available in processing area; but bringing minimal scaffolding from resource area is optional).
- Player C should carry banners in hotbar and trapdoors in hotbar to speed placement on arrival.
- Use sprint + diagonal runs between resource/processing/build to save seconds; minimize idling at furnaces/crafting tables.

Concise execution checklist (to run at start)
1. Assign roles (A/B builders, C processor).
2. A picks 5 iron_blocks + 3 bars → go to structure.
3. B picks 4 iron_blocks + 3 bars → go to structure.
4. C picks 2 iron_blocks + 48 wool + 2 logs → go to processing.
5. A/B place iron_blocks and iron_bars immediately and in parallel.
6. C crafts trapdoors (2 blocks → 18 ingots → 3 crafts → 6 trapdoors), crafts sticks, crafts 8 white banners, recolors banners to red.
7. C runs to structure, places trapdoors (orient as required) while A/B place banners.
8. Final check, adjust, finish.

If you want, I can convert this into a timed second-by-second script for all three players (with estimated running times between coordinates) or a quick in‑game hotbar/inventory packing checklist for each player. Which would help you most?

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
PlayerA: Collect 5 iron_blocks and 3 iron_bars with correct orientation from resource area. After collection, go directly to the building area and start placing iron_blocks on the left half of the structure without delay. Then place your 3 iron_bars in their exact positions matching required orientation. Be ready to place banners or assist with final trapdoors when PlayerC arrives. PlayerB: Collect 4 iron_blocks and 3 iron_bars with correct orientation from resource area. After collection, proceed straight to the building area and immediately place iron_blocks on the right half of the structure. Follow with placing your 3 iron_bars matching required orientation. Prepare to place banners or assist with trapdoors when PlayerC arrives. PlayerC: Collect 2 iron_blocks (for ingots), 48 white_wool, and 2 logs (if sticks are not pre-crafted) from resource area in one trip. Then move directly to processing area. At processing area, convert 2 iron_blocks into 18 iron_ingots. Craft 6 iron trapdoors by crafting trapdoor recipe 3 times from ingots. Craft sticks from logs, then craft 8 white banners using 48 white_wool and 8 sticks. Recolor all 8 banners to red using red_dye at processing. Once crafting complete, carry trapdoors and red banners in hotbar and run directly to structure. Upon arrival, call out "Ready for placement [specify directions]" and immediately begin placing trapdoors with correct orientation while coordinating with PlayerA and PlayerB who place banners and do final adjustments. All players stay focused on seamless handoffs and minimize waiting.
