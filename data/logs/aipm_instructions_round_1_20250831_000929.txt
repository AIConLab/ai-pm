AIPM Player Instructions - Round 1

==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan for Round 1 – Structure 1

1. Overview & Critical Path  
– We must fetch and prepare three block groups in parallel, then assemble on-site:  
  • Oak stairs (20 total, 5 per facing)  
  • Light-gray concrete (25 blocks)  
  • Iron bars (5)  
– Bottleneck: concrete conversion and stair crafting. These must run concurrently with resource hauling.  

2. Player Roles & Zones  
– P1 (Stair Specialist)  
  • Zone: Resource → Processing (crafting table) → Build site  
  • Task: Collect oak logs → craft planks → craft stairs → deliver stairs  
– P2 (Concrete Specialist)  
  • Zone: Resource → Processing (water source) → Build site  
  • Task: Collect concrete powder → convert to concrete blocks → deliver blocks  
– P3 (Bar Specialist & Site Prep)  
  • Zone: Resource → Build site  
  • Task: Collect iron bars → run site-prep (scaffolding, staging) → deliver bars  

3. Resource Collection Sequence (all start at Resource Area X34.398,Z-83.75)  
– P1:  
  1. Grab 8 oak_logs  
  2. Hotbar/sprint to Processing (–69.365,-84.426)  
– P2:  
  1. Grab 25 light_gray_concrete_powder + empty bucket  
  2. Sprint to Processing  
– P3:  
  1. Grab 5 iron_bars (any orientation)  
  2. Direct to Build site (–20.672,-86.143), start scaffolding setup  

4. Processing Workflow (parallel)  
– P1 at crafting table:  
  • Log → 32 planks → craft 20 oak stairs (need 30 planks)  
  • As stairs finish, load into inventory (stack in slot 1)  
– P2 at water source:  
  • Place 25 powder on floor in one layer  
  • Use bucket (water) to convert all to concrete blocks  
  • Break up blocks, stack into inventory (slot 1)  
– P3 idle until arrival on site—prepares staging area (mark floor footprint, place scaffolding)  

5. Delivery & Build Sequence  
– As soon as P1 crafts a stack of stairs, run to Build site, hand off to P3 and/or begin placing  
– As soon as P2 converts blocks, run to site, hand off to P3 and/or begin placing  
– P3 organizes delivered materials around the footprint for immediate access  

6. Construction Milestones & Parallelism  
Milestone A (t0+0–15 s)  
  • All players reach Resource area and begin collection  
Milestone B (t0+15–45 s)  
  • P1 and P2 arrive at Processing; P3 arrives at Build site, sets scaffold (height + access)  
Milestone C (t0+45–75 s)  
  • P1 completes stairs; P2 completes concrete; both en route to site  
Milestone D (t0+75–120 s)  
  • Bulk placement:  
    – P1 places all oak stairs around perimeter (assign directions by group of 5)  
    – P2 places all 25 light-gray concrete in the core  
    – P3 installs 5 iron bars into their exact positions  
Milestone E (t0+120–135 s)  
  • Final check (orientation, waterlogged flags=false) → Complete  

7. Communication Checkpoints  
– “Logs/powder/bars collected” → P1/P2/P3 start moving to processing/site  
– “Stairs ready” → P1 departing → P3 pause site-prep and mark stair slots  
– “Concrete ready” → P2 departing → P3 pause if conflict on scaffolding  
– “All materials on site” → Rapid fill, call out missing blocks  

8. Inventory & Hotbar Setup  
– Slot 1: primary output (stairs, blocks, bars)  
– Slot 2–4: tool (axe for logs, pick for iron, shovel if needed)  
– Slot 5: bucket (P2), scaffolding (P3)  
– Remaining: empty to stage just-in-time delivery  

Key to speed: maximal overlap—while P1/P2 process, P3 primes the site. Tight hand-offs eliminate return trips. Follow the milestones rigorously for sub-2-minute completion.

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
jc_cr (acting as P1 – Stair Specialist):
1. Move immediately to Resource Area (X = 34.398, Z = –83.75).  
2. Chop down and collect exactly 8 oak_logs.  
   • Success = inventory contains 8 oak_logs.  
3. Hotbar-slot 2: equip any axe; clear slot 1 for output.  
4. Sprint to Processing Table at (X = –69.365, Z = –84.426).  
   • Success = you are standing at the crafting table with 8 logs in inventory.

P2 (Concrete Specialist – to be occupied by next available player):
1. Upon joining, teleport or run to Resource Area (34.398, –83.75).  
2. Collect 25 light_gray_concrete_powder and 1 empty bucket.  
   • Success = inventory slots 1 = powder (25), slot 5 = bucket.  
3. Proceed to Water Source at (–69.365, –84.300).  
   • Ready to lay out powder in one layer and convert to blocks.

P3 (Bar Specialist & Site Prep – to be occupied by next available player):
1. Upon joining, collect 5 iron_bars at Resource Area (34.398, –83.75).  
   • Success = inventory slot 1 = 5 iron_bars.  
2. Run directly to Build Site (X = –20.672, Z = –86.143).  
3. Begin scaffolding setup around the planned footprint (mark corners).  
   • Success = footprint marked and 5 scaffolding blocks placed for easy access.

Next Checkpoint:
• jc_cr posts “Logs collected” → immediately start planks→stairs crafting.  
• P2/P3 to post “Powder collected” / “Bars collected” as soon as they finish their Resource-area runs.
