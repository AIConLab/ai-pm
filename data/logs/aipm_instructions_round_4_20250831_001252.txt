==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
RESOURCE COLLECTION PRIORITIES  
• Iron blocks (12 × “minecraft:iron_block”) – one stack, direct build blocks  
• Orange concrete powder (19 × “minecraft:orange_concrete_powder”) – convert to concrete  
• Redstone torches (4 × “minecraft:redstone_torch”) – final decoration  
• Iron trapdoors (27 × “minecraft:iron_trapdoor”) and iron doors (2 × “minecraft:iron_door”) – craft from ingots at processing  

PROCESSING & CRAFTING TIMELINE  
T0 – Start  
• Player 3 → Processing area (–69,66,–84):  
 – Begin trapdoor (27) and door (2) crafting on the crafting table (≈30 s).  
 – Prepare water source at adjacent block for concrete conversion.  
• Player 1 & Player 2 → Resource area (34,65,–83.75) (≈10 s run)  

T10  
• Player 1 at Resource: grab 12 iron blocks + 19 concrete powder.  
• Player 2 at Resource: grab 4 redstone torches + stand by to ferry powder if needed.  

T12  
• Player 1 & Player 2 → return toward Processing (≈19 s run)  

T30  
• Player 1 hands off concrete powder at water-station.  
• Player 3 dumps powder into water → collects 19 orange concrete (≈5 s).  
• Player 3 picks up finished trapdoors + doors as crafting completes (~T36–37).  

T30–40  
• Player 1 → Structure (-20.7,65.0,-86.1) with iron blocks + 4 torches (≈10 s).  
• Player 2 → Structure carrying any overflow torches or placeholder scaffolding.  
• Player 3 → picks up orange concrete + trapdoors + doors → run to Structure (≈10 s).  

BUILD EXECUTION SEQUENCE  
1. Foundation frame (iron blocks)  
 • P1 & P2 place 12 iron blocks immediately on arrival (≈12 s).  
2. Shell infill (orange concrete)  
 • Once frame is set, P1/P2 start filling with 19 orange concrete, P3 joins.  
3. Detail placement (doors, trapdoors, torches)  
 • Doors (2) into central opening; power them open.  
 • Place 27 trapdoors in specified facings/half-states.  
 • Mount 4 redstone torches at their precise positions.  

CRITICAL PATH & PARALLELISM  
• Trapdoor/door crafting (30 s) overlaps resource runs + start of block placement.  
• Concrete conversion (5 s) tucked inside crafting window.  
• Iron block frame (12 s) finished before P3 returns with second-wave materials.  

TASK ALLOCATION  
Player 1  
  • Primary ferryman: iron blocks, concrete powder → process → build frame + infill  
Player 2  
  • Secondary ferryman: redstone torches → assist building frame & infill → detail support  
Player 3  
  • Processor/Crafter: trapdoors & doors + concrete conversion → return with details → finish decorations  

KEY MILESTONES & COMMUNICATION  
• “T10 @ Resource ready”  
• “T30 @ Processing powder done, trapdoors ≈ 50%”  
• “T40 Frame start at Structure”  
• “T52 Frame complete”  
• “T68 Concrete & doors complete”  
• “T70 Trapdoors + torches complete – structure identical”  

Estimated total completion ~70 s. Continuous voice pings at each milestone ensure synchronization and immediate hand-offs.

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
Player jc_cr:

T0 (now) → Run to Resource area  
  • Location: X 34 Y 65 Z –83.75  
  • Goal by T10:  
    – 12 × iron blocks  
    – 19 × orange concrete powder  
    – 4 × redstone torches  

T10 → Return to Processing area  
  • Location: X –69 Y 66 Z –84  
  • Arrive by ~T30  

T30 → At Processing station  
  1. Place water in conversion trough → dump 19 powder → collect 19 orange concrete (≤5 s)  
  2. On crafting table: craft  
     – 27 iron trapdoors  
     – 2 iron doors  
     (≈30 s total, finish by ~T37)  

T37 → Load up all processed materials:  
  • 19 orange concrete  
  • 27 iron trapdoors  
  • 2 iron doors  

T38 → Run to Build area  
  • Location: X –20.7 Y 65 Z –86.1  
  • Arrive by ~T48  

T48 → BUILD SEQUENCE  
  1. Foundation (iron blocks)  
     • Place all 12 iron blocks in frame pattern (≈12 s) → finish by T60  
  2. Shell infill (orange concrete)  
     • Fill remaining shell with 19 concrete (≈12 s) → finish by T72  
  3. Details  
     a. Install 2 iron doors in central opening; power them open (≤5 s)  
     b. Place 27 trapdoors in correct facings/half‐states (≤10 s)  
     c. Mount 4 redstone torches at marked spots (≤5 s)  

T90 → SUCCESS CRITERIA  
  • 12‐block iron frame placed  
  • 19 concrete blocks infilled  
  • 2 doors installed & open  
  • 27 trapdoors all correctly oriented  
  • 4 torches in exact positions  

Call out “T10 ready,” “T30 processing done,” “T48 at build” as you hit each mark. Continuous push to minimize idle time—every second counts. Good luck!
