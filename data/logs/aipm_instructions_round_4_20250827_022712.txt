==================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:
Strategic Plan – Round 4 (Structure 4)

1. RESOURCE COLLECTION  
  • Players: P1, P2 depart immediately from build site. P3 stays at Processing.  
  • P1 → Resource Area (34.4, 65, –83.75):  
    – Grab 12 × iron_block (full stacks)  
  • P2 → Resource Area:  
    – Grab 19 × orange_concrete_powder  
    – Grab 4 × redstone_torch  
  • Return routes: use straight-line sprint to Processing area (–69.4, 66, –84.4), tag P3.  
  • P3 → no collection trip; readies Processing station.

2. PROCESSING WORKFLOW  
  • Total ingot need: 60 (for 27 trapdoors + 1 iron door). Blocks→ingots: 7 blocks → 63 ingots; leaves 5 blocks.  
  • P3 at Processing (crafting table + water bucket):  
    – T=0–15s: receives 7 iron blocks from P1 → craft into 63 ingots (crafting grid).  
    – T=15–30s: craft 27 iron_trapdoors (4 ingots→2 trapdoors) and 1 iron_door (6 ingots→3 doors); set aside exact count.  
    – T=15–30s parallel: use water bucket + crafting/conversion trick to turn 19 orange_concrete_powder → 19 orange_concrete.  
  • P3 sorts into bundled stacks:  
    – 27 iron_trapdoors (in 5 stacks: 12 closed-north, 6 closed-east, 1 open-south, 4 open-east, 4 open-west)  
    – 1 iron_door lower+upper  
    – 19 orange_concrete  
    – 4 redstone_torch  

3. BUILD EXECUTION SEQUENCE  
  Assign zones at build site (–20.7, 65, –86.1):  
  • Foundation & Frame (critical path): iron_block & orange_concrete  
  • Detail & Redstone: trapdoors, door, torches  
  • Cleanup & Verify  

  Timeline & Parallel Tasks:  
   T=30s: P3 delivers processed items to build site; P1/P2 shuttle remaining 5 iron_blocks as needed.  
   T=30–50s (Phase 1 – Shell):  
     – P1 places all 12 iron_blocks per blueprint (skeleton).  
     – P2 lays 19 orange_concrete in correct pattern (walls).  
     – P3 pre-sorts trapdoors/door/torches at staging area.  
   T=50–65s (Phase 2 – Details):  
     – P1 installs iron_door (lower then upper), powers as required.  
     – P2 places 4 redstone_torch at specified coords.  
     – P3 places all 27 iron_trapdoors in their specified facing/open states.  
   T=65–75s (Phase 3 – Verification):  
     – Quick walk-around to verify orientation & open/powered states.  
     – Fix any mis-placements (<5s).  

4. TEAM COORDINATION & MILESTONES  
  • Checkpoint A (T≈15s): P1/P2 back at Processing with raw mats  
  • Checkpoint B (T≈30s): P3 has completed crafting & conversion  
  • Checkpoint C (T≈50s): Structural shell complete  
  • Checkpoint D (T≈65s): All detail blocks placed  
  • Finish (T≤75s): Final QA pass – Submit structure  

Player Roles Summary  
  • P1 – Iron frames & door installation  
  • P2 – Orange concrete walls & torches  
  • P3 – Processing (craft & convert) → trapdoor placement & QA  

Key Focus  
  • Start processing immediately (critical path = trapdoors)  
  • Maximize parallelism: two build-instead of fetch/trade after T=30s  
  • Clear checkpoints every 15–20 s to keep tempo and verify alignment.

==================================================

PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:
Player jc_cr – you are solo on P1/P2/P3 roles. Follow these timed, milestone tasks:

1. T=0 s → Resource Collection (at 34.4, 65, –83.75)  
• Sprint to X 34.4 Y 65 Z –83.75.  
• Break and collect:  
  – 12 × iron_block  
  – 19 × orange_concrete_powder  
  – 4 × redstone_torch  
• Success: Inventory shows exactly those counts.  
• Immediately sprint (straight‐line) to Processing at X –69.4 Y 66 Z –84.4.

Checkpoint A (≈15 s): have raw materials at Processing.

2. T≈15 s → Processing Station (crafting table + water)  
a) Iron → Ingots → Trapdoors & Door  
  • Place 7 iron_blocks in crafting grid → 63 iron_ingots.  
  • Craft:  
    – 27 iron_trapdoors (4 ingots→2 trapdoors)  
    – 1 iron_door (6 ingots→3 door blocks)  
  • Set aside exactly: 27 trapdoors + 1 door (lower & upper).  

b) Concrete Conversion  
  • Fill a 1×1 hole with water.  
  • Right-click water with orange_concrete_powder until you have 19 orange_concrete.  

c) Sort stacks on ground in four piles:  
  – Stack A: 27 iron_trapdoors  
  – Stack B: 1 iron_door (2 blocks)  
  – Stack C: 19 orange_concrete  
  – Stack D: 4 redstone_torch  

Checkpoint B (≈30 s): All processed items ready in four piles.

3. T≈30 s → Delivery to Build Site (–20.7, 65, –86.1)  
• Pick up all four piles + remaining 5 iron_blocks.  
• Sprint to X –20.7 Y 65 Z –86.1.  
• Drop piles in staging area on ground, grouped by type.

4. T=30–50 s (Phase 1 – Shell)  
• Iron Frame (12 iron_blocks):  
  – Place 3-high vertical columns at each corner of the 6×6 footprint:  
    * Corner NW: X –22 Z –88, Y 65–67 (3 blocks)  
    * NE: X –16 Z –88, Y 65–67  
    * SE: X –16 Z –82, Y 65–67  
    * SW: X –22 Z –82, Y 65–67  
• Orange Walls (19 orange_concrete):  
  – Fill between columns on all four sides at Y 65–67 according to reference pattern.  
• Success: 12 iron_blocks + 19 orange_concrete fully placed, matches shell outline.

Checkpoint C (≈50 s): Shell complete.

5. T=50–65 s (Phase 2 – Details)  
• Iron Door & Redstone:  
  – At entry (X –19 Z –82), place lower door block at Y 65, upper at Y 66.  
  – Power door with one of your 4 redstone_torch: place directly adjacent on wall.  
• Trapdoors (27 total):  
  – Place each trapdoor in its exact position & orientation per blueprint:  
    * 12 closed-north, 6 closed-east, 1 open-south, 4 open-east (up), 4 open-west (up).  
• Success: Door correctly placed & powers open/close; all 27 trapdoors in correct states.

Checkpoint D (≈65 s): All details installed.

6. T=65–75 s (Phase 3 – QA & Submit)  
• Walk entire perimeter:  
  – Verify block types, orientations, open states, torch power.  
  – Fix any misplacements (≤ 5 s).  
• Once perfect, stand at build origin (–20.7, 65, –86.1) and signal “Done.”  

Finish target: complete structure by 75 s or sooner. Good luck!
